	abstract = {Attempted to study the scientific correlation between two things. Any correlational experiment can only be regarded as a sample and presents a certain amount of accidental deviation from the real general tendency. Accidental deviation can be measured by the 'probable error.' Accidental deviation depends on the number or cases, and on the largeness of existing correspondence. Probable error varies according to the method of calculation. While the number of Ss helps to reduce accidental deviation, it has no effect upon systematic deviation, except that it indirectly leads to an augmentation. Therefore, the number of cases should be determined by the principle that the measurements to be aggregated together should have their error brought to the same general order of magnitude. Suggests that probable errors must be kept down to limits small enough for the particular object of investigation to be proved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {A total diet study (TDS) was conducted between 2010 and 2016 to assess the risk associated with chemicals in food of non-breast-fed children from 1 to 36 months living in France. Food samples were collected, prepared “as consumed”, and analyzed for chemicals of public health interest. Acrylamide, furan and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed as heat-induced compounds produced mainly during thermal processing of foods. Dietary exposure was assessed for 705 representative children using food consumptions recorded through a 3-consecutive-days record. As all calculated margins of exposure (MOE) for PAHs exceeded 10 000, dietary exposure of the infant and toddler population was deemed tolerable with regard to the carcinogenic risk. Conversely, the exposure levels to acrylamide and furan were considered as of concern, requiring management measures to reduce the exposure essentially by reducing the formation of heat-induced compounds during food production or preparation processes. Efforts should mainly focus on major contributors to the exposure, i.e. sweet and savoury biscuits and bars, and potatoes and potato products for acrylamide, baby jars of vegetables, with or without meat or fish for acrylamide and furan.},

	abstract = {As described in Chapter 2, the responsibilities of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) new Office of Foods include providing executive leadership and management to all FDA food-related programs; directing the development of integrated strategies, plans, policies, and budgets to build the FDA’s food-related scientific and regulatory capacities and programs, including the recruitment and training of key personnel and the development of information systems (FDA, 2009); and exercising direct line authority over the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Its responsibilities include both short-term decision making in direct response to a food crisis and longer-term initiatives focused on sustained, continued improvement in food safety and public health. The former responsibility requires rapid decision making in cooperation with multiple regulatory partners, while the latter requires long-term strategic planning aimed at proactive activities that are based on data and risk-based prediction and prioritization. For example, the FDA’s responsibility during a foodborne illness outbreak would focus on identification of the source of contamination (product trace-back), initiation of regulatory action, and product recall. More proactive activities might involve conducting research to address crucial unknowns, undertaking formalized quantitative risk assessment, identifying candidate mitigation strategies to prevent repeat incidents, and ensuring the implementation of those strategies. Critical to both long- and short-term initiatives are improvements in cooperation with partners (see Chapters 4 and 7); efficient data collection, sharing, and analysis (Chapter 5); and communication with the public (Chapter 9).},

The terms "Big Data" and "Decision Support Systems" (DSS) refer to computerised multidimensional data management systems that support stakeholders in making use of modern data-driven approaches to identify and solve problems and to enable enhanced decision making. Big Data has become ubiquitous in food safety. Information in the food supply chain is scattered and involves heterogenicity in format, scale, geographical origin. Also, interactions among environmental factors, food contamination, and foodborne diseases are complex, dynamic, and challenging to predict. Therefore, this state-of-the-art review article focuses on the underlying architecture of Big Data and web-based technologies for food safety, focusing on climate change influences. Challenges in adopting Big Data in food safety are presented, and future research directions regarding technologies/methods in the food supply chain are summarised and analysed. The analysis and discussion provided aim to assist agri-food researchers and stakeholders in taking initiatives and gathering insights on the application of Big Data and web-based DSS for food safety, which would alleviate challenges and facilitate the implementation of Big Data in food safety risk assessment while considering the possible implications of climate change.},

A series of high profile food incidents, which have been ineffectively managed by both the regulators and the industry, and where there has been a failure to be open and transparent, have sensitised a proportion of consumers to scary stories about the food supply. There has been concomitant damage to consumer confidence in (i) the safety of food, (ii) the food industry’s commitment to producing safe food and (iii) the authorities’ ability to oversee the food chain. Threats to consumers’ health and their genuine concerns have to be addressed with effective risk management and the protection of public health has to be paramount. Dealing with incorrect fears and misperceptions of risk has also to be addressed but achieving this is very difficult. The competencies of social scientists are needed to assist in gaining insights into consumer perceptions of risk, consumer behaviour and the determinants of trust. Conventional risk communication will not succeed on its own and more innovative and creative communication strategies are needed to engage with consumers using all available media channels in an open and transparent way. The digital media affords the opportunity to revolutionise engagement with consumers on food safety and nutrition-related issues.},

	abstract = {Understanding the consumers' perception of food-related risks is important in health and risk communication. Therefore, two surveys were conducted among consumers (n = 2005 in 2009 and n = 1014 in 2018) and experts (n = 62 in 2009 and n = 65 in 2018) in the Netherlands to evaluate their familiarity with and perception of food-related risks related to health, food safety and new technologies. In both surveys (2009 and 2018), experts scored unbalanced diet as highest risk followed by food poisoning, and chemicals formed during preparation. The consumers' risk scoring changed over the years and came more in line with the experts' scoring. Like the experts, consumers scored unbalanced diet as highest food risk in 2018, in contrast with 2009 when environmental contaminants were scored as the highest food risk by the consumers. Consumers perceived chemical risks and risks associated with new technologies significantly higher than experts in both years. Socio-demographic characteristics, like age and gender affected the risk scoring, because older consumers perceived risks higher than younger consumers and women higher than men. Consumers familiarity with the various food risks differed largely, with highest familiarity with the risks food poisoning and unbalanced diet. A shift towards higher risk perception and awareness of the risk of unbalanced diet by consumers is an important factor in fighting food-related diseases. This study provides insight into consumers’ perception of food-related risks, which besides technical-scientific information, is essential to design a clear and targeted health- and risk communication strategy.},

Past consumer food-safety education programs have only been modestly successful. Optimism bias may distort food-safety risk perceptions encouraging participation in risky food behaviors. Using multiple years of the FDA Food Safety Survey data, we explore the link between behavior-specific risk perceptions and three food-handling practices: handwashing, avoiding cross-contamination, and proper refrigeration of cooked foods. This approach describes risk perceptions as endogenous variables and allows for the decomposition of factors that directly influence food-safety behaviors, from those that indirectly influence behavior by changing risk perceptions. Our results suggest well-designed targeted information campaigns aimed at improving people’s safe food-handling practices must first decrease people’s optimism in the safety of their current practices. Given the lack of regulatory options to influence behavior in the home, this may provide an effective tool to address issues in performing safe food handling.},

	abstract = {In accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 16/2011, the exceedance of a legal limit, i.e. ‘non-compliance’ with a regulatory framework (European or National) does not systematically trigger a RASFF notification. An evaluation on the level of risk is necessary to decide if a notification should be issued. EFSA was requested to propose a risk evaluation methodology that would allow a rapid and consistent risk-based classification of RASFF notifications. The methodology aims to provide a transparent set of criteria that can support the decision whether to notify in RASFF and increase transparency and harmonization. The methodology was developed for evaluation of contaminants (arising from food contact materials, pharmacologically active substances and other food contaminants) in food. The risk evaluation is based on the assessment of toxicological properties and dietary exposure. The result, expressed as the comparison of exposure to a relevant toxicological reference point, can be classified as no risk; low probability of adverse health effects or low concern for public health; potential risk; or risk. To facilitate the evaluation, the “Rapid Assessment of Contaminant Exposure (RACE)” tool was developed. It uses food consumption information from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database to provide estimates of acute and chronic exposure from single foods and compares the result to the relevant toxicological reference points. The implementation of the FoodEx2 (food categories) and PARAM (hazards) controlled terminologies in the RASFF system is recommended to improve harmonization and facilitate the evaluation.},

The important lesson is that risk communicators must analyze the situational characteristics of the microbial hazards they are confronting and should design their messages accordingly. While risk communication research involving other types of hazards can inform efforts to design communications about microbial risks, concerns about food risks also have unique characteristics that should be considered independently of perceptions of hazards in other domains. As with studies examining hand-washing behaviors, researchers have found demographic differences in risky food-handling and -consumption behaviors. Food labels can serve a comparable role, though they often provide information to consumers but fail to explain why or how to use. The disclosure of severe consequences experienced by others can also trigger teachable moments, especially if the actors or victims involved bear similarity to your target audience. Witte and Allen conclude that risk communicators can best develop effective fear appeal messages by increasing references to both the severity of the threat and the target audience's susceptibility to it.},

The present investigation attempted to understand consumer perceptions associated with chemical and microbiological contaminants in four specific food chains (drinking water, farmed salmon, chicken and milk powder). To this end, ten focus group discussions were held in five different countries (Poland, Ireland, the Netherlands, France and Brazil). Consumers expressed higher concerns about chemical, as compared with microbial, contaminants. Chemical contaminants were more strongly associated with the potential for severe consequences, long-term effects and lack of personal control. Traceability was considered by consumers as a useful tool that offers the potential to improve consumer confidence in food safety.},

In this study, we analyzed public appraisals of uncertain risks of food additives and contaminants. We identified three major characteristics of public appraisal. First, hazard appraisals differed consistently from risk appraisals: respondents were less disturbed by a possible health risk than by the mere presence of the chemical substance in food. Second, while a majority understood that exposure determines whether a chemical constitutes a risk, many respondents thought that all chemicals are equally harmful. This suggests a mismatch between beliefs about exposure and beliefs about toxicity. Finally, the higher people valued certainty about food safety and the less they considered uncertainty about a risk acceptable, the more severe they appraised the presence of the chemical substance in food. This suggests that a mismatch between the level of uncertainty that people expect about food safety and the actual level of scientific uncertainty, affects how people evaluate the presence of chemical substances in food. Following the findings, implications for risk communication are discussed.},

In line with Sustainable Development Goals 3 “Good health and well-being” and 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production”, this paper is concerned with the fragile population of the less-than-3-years-old children. More specifically, it investigates how infant food safety is perceived at the household level and at the level of childhood and health professionals directly in contact with them. Objective. The paper aims to analyze consumer priorities and perceptions of hazards in infant foods qualitatively and quantitatively. Methodology. To do so, a survey was carried out in France on 1750 people representative of the general population. A hybrid method is proposed to analyze the results of the survey, mixing artificial intelligence and statistics. Main insights. Within the declared priorities when choosing infant food, health comes first, with a top ranking for the absence of harmful substances, followed closely by nutritional balance—far ahead of environment, ease of use and price. The results show that the rankings of the hazards that cause the most worry are globally homogeneous throughout the populations (families, professionals, etc.) and higher for chemical contaminants from agricultural practices and packaging. For health professionals, concerns are higher than in the general population for all categories of contaminants, and specific concerns such as risk related to environmental and unknown contaminants are much more prevalent. The perception of risk varies with the food considered. For infant formula in particular, users seem puzzled by somehow contradictory messages. Perspectives. The study is intended to be generalized to Europe.},

Alternative time-temperature conditions were evaluated to the permitted treatment of at least 90°C for at least 90 seconds (s) in the mollusc flesh. The most important viral hazards associated with bivalve molluscs were identified as Norovirus (NoV) and Hepatitis A virus (HAV). A HAV thermal inactivation model was developed to identify equivalent (achieve the same log reduction) time-temperature combinations to 90°C for 90 s. The model was based on HAV inactivation data in mollusc matrices during isothermal heat treatment and estimated the z-value as 27.5°C. Evaluation against inactivation in whole bivalve molluscs showed that the observed HAV inactivation is in general higher than predicted. Under the conditions and matrices studied HAV is generally more heat tolerant than NoV surrogates. The model provided alternative processes equivalent to 90°C for 90 s without considering the effect of heat-up and cool-down times on virus inactivation. As confirmed by industrial profiles, there is a heat-up and cool-down time that will enhance the safety of the final product and can lead to variations in HAV reduction depending on the process design. This shows the need for a Performance Criterion (PC) for the whole process, which is the required log reduction during heat treatment. A risk assessment model was developed and a case study illustrated the relationship between a PC and the HAV risk at consumption. If risk managers establish an ALOP, this can be translated to a PC and a Process Criterion (PrC). It is demonstrated that a PrC expressed as an F-value (the equivalent processing time of a hypothetical isothermal process at a reference temperature) is more appropriate than the currently used time-temperature combination since it takes into account non-isothermal conditions.},

This has resulted in an increasingly complex network of food trade and has made importing countries vulnerable to the spread of foodborne disease outbreaks originating from “foreign” food networks. Analysis of these networks can provide information on potential food safety risks and also on the potential spread of these risks through the food network in question. In this study, network theory has been used to analyse global trade. A mathematical model was developed enabling a simulation of the distribution of food products based on the publicly available data on international imports, exports and production provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, the impact that the network structure has on the distribution of food products in terms of food safety risks. As a case study, a recent trans-national food safety incident was analysed, illustrating the potential application of the model in a foodborne pathogen outbreak. Using only the type of contaminated food and the countries where the outbreak was reported, the model was used to identify the most likely origin of the contaminated eggs, narrowing down the options to three countries (including the actual origin). Furthermore, it is used to identify those countries with significant food safety risks, due to imports of food produced in these three countries. The approach can help regulatory agencies and the food industry to design improved surveillance and risk mitigation actions against transnational food safety risks.},

	abstract = {Background Foodborne diseases are important worldwide, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, we present the first global and regional estimates of the disease burden of the most important foodborne bacterial, protozoal, and viral diseases. Methods and Findings We synthesized data on the number of foodborne illnesses, sequelae, deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), for all diseases with sufficient data to support global and regional estimates, by age and region. The data sources included varied by pathogen and included systematic reviews, cohort studies, surveillance studies and other burden of disease assessments. We sought relevant data circa 2010, and included sources from 1990–2012. The number of studies per pathogen ranged from as few as 5 studies for bacterial intoxications through to 494 studies for diarrheal pathogens. To estimate mortality for Mycobacterium bovis infections and morbidity and mortality for invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica infections, we excluded cases attributed to HIV infection. We excluded stillbirths in our estimates. We estimate that the 22 diseases included in our study resulted in two billion (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.5–2.9 billion) cases, over one million (95\% UI 0.89–1.4 million) deaths, and 78.7 million (95\% UI 65.0–97.7 million) DALYs in 2010. To estimate the burden due to contaminated food, we then applied proportions of infections that were estimated to be foodborne from a global expert elicitation. Waterborne transmission of disease was not included. We estimate that 29\% (95\% UI 23–36\%) of cases caused by diseases in our study, or 582 million (95\% UI 401–922 million), were transmitted by contaminated food, resulting in 25.2 million (95\% UI 17.5–37.0 million) DALYs. Norovirus was the leading cause of foodborne illness causing 125 million (95\% UI 70–251 million) cases, while Campylobacter spp. caused 96 million (95\% UI 52–177 million) foodborne illnesses. Of all foodborne diseases, diarrheal and invasive infections due to non-typhoidal S. enterica infections resulted in the highest burden, causing 4.07 million (95\% UI 2.49–6.27 million) DALYs. Regionally, DALYs per 100,000 population were highest in the African region followed by the South East Asian region. Considerable burden of foodborne disease is borne by children less than five years of age. Major limitations of our study include data gaps, particularly in middle- and high-mortality countries, and uncertainty around the proportion of diseases that were foodborne. Conclusions Foodborne diseases result in a large disease burden, particularly in children. Although it is known that diarrheal diseases are a major burden in children, we have demonstrated for the first time the importance of contaminated food as a cause. There is a need to focus food safety interventions on preventing foodborne diseases, particularly in low- and middle-income settings.},

	abstract = {Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the most important form of vitamin B6 serves as a cofactor for many proteins. Two alternative pathways for de novo PLP biosynthesis are known: the short deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP)-independent pathway, which is present in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the longer DXP-dependent pathway, which has been intensively studied in the Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli. Previous studies revealed that bacteria contain many promiscuous enzymes causing a so-called ‘underground metabolism’, which can be important for the evolution of novel pathways. Here, we evaluated the potential of B. subtilis to use a truncated non-native DXP-dependent PLP pathway from E. coli for PLP synthesis. Adaptive laboratory evolution experiments revealed that two non-native enzymes catalysing the last steps of the DXP-dependent PLP pathway and two genomic alterations are sufficient to allow growth of vitamin B6 auxotrophic bacteria as rapid as the wild type. Thus, the existence of an underground metabolism in B. subtilis facilitates the generation of a pathway for synthesis of PLP using parts of a non-native vitamin B6 pathway. The introduction of non-native enzymes into a metabolic network and rewiring of native metabolism could be helpful to generate pathways that might be optimized for producing valuable substances.},

	abstract = {The deviations from log-linearity that are often observed in bacterial survivor curves can be explained using different arguments, both biological and experimental. In this study, we used Bacillus subtilis as a model organism to demonstrate that the generally accepted vitalistic arguments (initial heterogeneities in the stress resistance of the cells in the population) may fail to describe microbial inactivation in some situations. In this sense, we showed how dynamic stress acclimation during an isothermal treatment provides an alternative explanation for survivor curves with an upwards curvature. We also provided an innovative experimental approach based on preadaptation experiments to evaluate which hypothesis is more suitable for the bacterial response. Furthermore, we used our experimental results to define bounds for the possible stress acclimation that may take place during dynamic treatments, concluding that the magnitude of stress acclimation may be larger for dynamic treatments than for isothermal experiments. We also evaluated the contribution of the SigB general stress response system to heat resistance by comparing the heat survival of wt and the ΔsigB mutant. Both strains survived better in 51, 52.5 and 55 °C when cells were pre-adapted at 48 °C than non-pre-adapted cells. However, ΔsigB was less resistant to heat than wt due to the missing SigB general stress system. Although these conclusions were based on B. subtilis as a model organism, this study can be the first step towards the development of a novel methodology able to estimate dynamic effects using only isothermal experiments. This would improve the models developed within the predictive microbiology community, improving our ability to predict microbial inactivation during industrial treatments, which are most often dynamic.},

	abstract = {An integrated approach to identify and assess Microbiological Hazards (MHs) and mitigate risks in infant food chains is crucial to ensure safe foods for infants and young children. A systematic procedure was developed to identify MHs in specific infant foods. This includes five major steps: 1) relevant hazard-food pairing, 2) process inactivation efficiency, 3) recontamination possibility after processing, 4) MHs growth opportunity, and 5) MHs-food association level. These steps were integrated into an online tool called the Microbiological Hazards IDentification (MiID) decision support system (DSS), targeting food companies, governmental agencies and academia users, and is accessible at https://foodmicrobiologywur.shinyapps.io/Microbial\_hazards\_ID/. The MiID DSS was validated in four case studies, focussing on infant formula, fruit puree, cereal-based meals, and fresh fruits, each representing distinct products and processing characteristics. The results obtained through the application of the MiID DSS, compared with identification by food safety experts, consistently identified the top MHs in these food products. This process affirms its effectiveness in systematic hazard identification. The introduction of the MiID DSS helps to structure the first steps in HACCP (hazard analysis) and in risk assessment (hazard identification) to follow a structured and well-documented procedure, balancing the risk of overlooking relevant MHs or including too many irrelevant MHs. It is a valuable addition to risk analysis/assessment in infant food chains and has the potential for future extension. This includes the incorporation of newly acquired data related to infant foods via a semi-publicly hosted platform, or it can be adapted for hazard identification in general food products using a similar framework.},

The authors identify how journalists/media actors use social media in identifying and creating news stories arguing that food regulators need to maintain a social media presence to ensure that accurate information about food safety is disseminated via social media. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through 105 semi-structured interviews. Findings While food regulators and representatives of the food industry identify advantages of social media including two-way communication and speed of transmission of information, they maintain concerns about information provided via social media fearing the potential for loss of control of the information and sensationalism. There is evidence, however, that media actors use social media to identify food stories, to find sources, gauge public opinion and to provide a human interest angle. Practical implications While there are commonalities between the three groups, concerns with social media reflect professional roles. Food regulators need to be aware of how media actors use social media and maintain a social media presence. Further, they need to monitor other sources to maintain consumer trust. Originality/value This paper adds to public debate through comparing the perspectives of the three groups of respondents each that have their own agendas which impact how they interact with and use social media.},

	abstract = {European food production systems have become very efficient in terms of high yield, quality and safety. However, these production systems are not sustainable since, amongst other reasons, a significant proportion of the production is wasted or lost in the supply chain. One of the strategies of the European Union is to achieve climate neutrality by moving towards a circular economy with better waste management. This includes, reducing food waste and losses, and reusing or recycling by-products of the food and feed production systems. A circular economy would greatly improve the sustainability of the European food systems, but attention must be paid to the emergence of (new) food safety hazards. New or not well-known hazards can occur because by-products are reintroduced into the system or new processing steps are used for recycling, and/or known hazards can accumulate in the food production chain due to the reuse of (by-)products. This review addresses food safety hazards in the circular biobased economy, covering the domains of plant production, animal production, aquaculture, and packaging. Instead of an exhaustive list of all potential hazards, example cases of circular food production systems are given, highlighting the known and potential emerging food safety hazards. Current literature covering emerging food safety hazards in the circular economy shows to be limited. Therefore, more research is needed to identify food safety hazards, to measure the accumulation and the distribution of such hazards in the food and feed production systems, and to develop control and mitigation strategies. We advocate a food safety by design approach.},

	abstract = {Background
The aims of risk communication to consumers are at least two-fold: to provide information about a food risk or safety issue, and for education purposes enabling a change towards safer behavior.
Scope and approach
In this paper, challenges confronting risk communicators in providing information consumers act upon will be summarily addressed. The emergence of web-based communication channels as avenues for improved dissemination will also be discussed.
Key findings and conclusions
Studies show that providing relevant risk messages to vulnerable consumers and target groups requires in-depth knowledge about the receivers of information. Characteristics of these groups may vary across countries, cultures and from case to case, therefore it may be necessary to collect more information about how risk communication should be presented and in which channels to reach the target groups. Messages should be repeated regularly and presented in a way that seems relevant to consumers; less statistics and more stories that they can relate to. Internet is rapidly becoming the number one information channel. Using social media, and web-based tools and games have the potential to rapidly reach specific target groups. Achieving behavior change is dependent on the consumers perceiving the risk information to be relevant for themselves.},

	abstract = {Understanding the consumers' perception of food-related risks is important in health and risk communication. Therefore, two surveys were conducted among consumers (n = 2005 in 2009 and n = 1014 in 2018) and experts (n = 62 in 2009 and n = 65 in 2018) in the Netherlands to evaluate their familiarity with and perception of food-related risks related to health, food safety and new technologies. In both surveys (2009 and 2018), experts scored unbalanced diet as highest risk followed by food poisoning, and chemicals formed during preparation. The consumers' risk scoring changed over the years and came more in line with the experts' scoring. Like the experts, consumers scored unbalanced diet as highest food risk in 2018, in contrast with 2009 when environmental contaminants were scored as the highest food risk by the consumers. Consumers perceived chemical risks and risks associated with new technologies significantly higher than experts in both years. Socio-demographic characteristics, like age and gender affected the risk scoring, because older consumers perceived risks higher than younger consumers and women higher than men. Consumers familiarity with the various food risks differed largely, with highest familiarity with the risks food poisoning and unbalanced diet. A shift towards higher risk perception and awareness of the risk of unbalanced diet by consumers is an important factor in fighting food-related diseases. This study provides insight into consumers’ perception of food-related risks, which besides technical-scientific information, is essential to design a clear and targeted health- and risk communication strategy.},

The values for the inactivation kinetic parameter (D), temperature coefficient (zT), and pressure coefficient (zP) were determined with a linear model. Inactivation parameters from the nonlinear Weibull model also were estimated. An increase in process pressure decreased the D-value at 95, 105, and 110°C; however, at 121°C the contribution of pressure to spore lethality was less pronounced. The zP-value increased from 170 MPa at 95°C to 332 MPa at 121°C, suggesting that B. amyloliquefaciens spores became less sensitive to pressure changes at higher temperatures. Similarly, the zT-value increased from 8.2°C at 0.1 MPa to 26.8°C at 700 MPa, indicating that at elevated pressures, the spores were less sensitive to changes in temperature. The nonlinear Weibull model parameter b increased with increasing pressure or temperature and was inversely related to the D-value.

Comparisons were made with three model (i.e., diluted) products, namely, 30\% (wt/wt) Bolognese sauce, 50\% (wt/wt) cream sauce, and rice water agar. Pressure was determined to act synergistically with heat during high-pressure thermal (HPT) processing for C. botulinum FRRB 2802 (NCTC 7273) and C. botulinum FRRB 2804 (NCTC 3805 and 62A) in the Bolognese and cream sauces and for C. botulinum FRRB 2807 (213B) in the Bolognese sauce only. No synergy was observed for C. botulinum FRRB 2803 (NCTC 2916) or FRRB 2806 (62A) or C. sporogenes FRRB 2790 (NCTC 8594 and PA3679) in any of the model products. No significant protective effect of pressure against spore inactivation was determined for any Clostridium strain in any product. Because synergy was not consistently observed among strains of C. botulinum or among products, the prediction of inactivation of C. botulinum spores by HPT sterilization (HPTS) for the present must assume a complete lack of synergy. Therefore, any HPTS process for low-acid shelf-stable foods must be at least thermally equivalent to an F0 process of 2.8 min, in line with current good manufacturing practices. The results of this study suggest that the use of C. sporogenes PA3679 as a surrogate organism may risk overestimating inactivation of C. botulinum by HPT processing.},

	abstract = {Clostridium (C.) botulinum type E belongs to the non-proteolytic physiological C. botulinum group II and produces the highly potent Botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) even at refrigerated temperatures. As C. botulinum type E spores are highly prevalent in aquatic environments, seafood and fishery products are commonly associated with this organism. Hydrostatic high pressure (HHP) treatments, or treatments combining HHP with elevated temperatures (HHPT), can be used to improve traditional preservation methods and increase food safety, quality and durability. In this study, we assessed the effect of different sporulation media and cation concentration on the heat resistance, HHP resistance, and HHPT resistance of spores from three C. botulinum type E strains. SFE (sediment fish extract) sporulation media yielded the most resistant spores, whereas, in M140 media, the least resistant spores were produced. Furthermore our results indicate that the divalent cation content (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) plays a role in the differential development of C. botulinum type E spore resistance to heat, HHP and HHPT in different media. Calcium cations confer heat and HPPT resistance to spores, while high amounts of magnesium cations appear to have a negative effect. Manganese cations in low concentrations are important for the development resistance to HPP and HPPT treatments, but not heat alone. This study provides valuable information on the nature of non-proteolytic C. botulinum type E spores grown in different media. The data provided here can be useful to the food industry and to researchers when considering spore properties in food safety risk assessment and the experimental design of future inactivation studies.},

	abstract = {Modification of pH and combined use of novel processing methods may be a good strategy to improve the quality of canned vegetables. In this study, selected thermal (TP) and high pressure-assisted thermal (HP-T) processing methods were validated for citric acid-infused carrots (pH ≤ 4.5) using Bacillus licheniformis spores. Previously established thermal inactivation kinetics data were used to setup the target process times (to achieve 7-log kill of B. licheniformis). The microbial spores were inoculated at the center of simulated carrot alginate beads and subjected to different processing methods. Delivered process lethalities, evaluated by the microbial count/re-count method and measured time–temperature data, were equal to or higher than the targeted values. No survivors were found after the treatments, demonstrating the adequacy of the processes. Texture, color and β-carotene retention in processed carrots, evaluated and compared with those processed under conventional canning, showed higher texture retention (P {\textless} 0.05) in the modified processing methods. Residual hardness values of carrots were 86\% with HP-T, 70\% with ohmic heating and 8\% with conventionally canned product. The same trend was observed with chewiness value. However, processing methods showed no differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) with respect to color change. In terms of β-carotene, carrots subjected to a relatively more severe heat treatment (water immersion mode in static retort) showed better β-carotene extractability than samples from HP-T. Practical Applications Conventional thermal processing of “low acid” foods (pH {\textgreater} 4.6) experiences significant quality loss due to the long thermal processing times required to inactivate spores of the key pathogen Clostridium botulinum. Alternative thermal processing techniques have evolved to shorten the processing times by enhancing heating rate to the product through process modifications or using thin profile packages. Even though quality retention can be enhanced through these modifications, thermal damage to quality is still indispensable since the sensitively microbial destruction to heat remain unaltered. Product acidification moves the “low acid” foods to “acid” category, thereby shifting the process regulation from the high temperature sterilization to the lower temperature pasteurization conditions. Savings in energy and reduction in process time immediately become obvious. Novel acidification methods are necessary for making the process efficient. Bacillus licheniformis is important and a suitable microorganism for validating thermal processing of acidified foods. The combined use of acid infusion methods and alternative thermal processing technologies could play a significant role to improve quality of acidified foods as compared to current practices.},

	abstract = {Clostridium botulinum produces Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), causing a rare but potentially deadly type of food poisoning called foodborne botulism. This review aims to provide information on the bacterium, spores, toxins, and botulisms, and describe the use of physical treatments (e.g., heating, pressure, irradiation, and other emerging technologies) to control this biological hazard in food. As the spores of this bacterium can resist various harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, the thermal inactivation of 12-log of C. botulinum type A spores remains the standard for the commercial sterilization of food products. However, recent advancements in non-thermal physical treatments present an alternative to thermal sterilization with some limitations. Low- ({\textless}2 kGy) and medium (3–5 kGy)-dose ionizing irradiations are effective for a log reduction of vegetative cells and spores, respectively; however, very high doses ({\textgreater}10 kGy) are required to inactivate BoNTs. High-pressure processing (HPP), even at 1.5 GPa, does not inactivate the spores and requires heat combination to achieve its goal. Other emerging technologies have also shown some promise against vegetative cells and spores; however, their application to C. botulinum is very limited. Various factors related to bacteria (e.g., vegetative stage, growth conditions, injury status, type of bacteria, etc.) food matrix (e.g., compositions, state, pH, temperature, aw, etc.), and the method (e.g., power, energy, frequency, distance from the source to target, etc.) influence the efficacy of these treatments against C. botulinum. Moreover, the mode of action of different physical technologies is different, which provides an opportunity to combine different physical treatment methods in order to achieve additive and/or synergistic effects. This review is intended to guide the decision-makers, researchers, and educators in using physical treatments to control C. botulinum hazards.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.3389/fpubh.2018.00306},
	abstract = {Background: The main process used to pasteurize human milk is the low-temperature, long-time Holder method. More recently, the high-temperature, short-time method has been investigated. Both processes lead to the appropriate inactivation of vegetative bacterial forms but are ineffective against bacterial spores. Research Aims/Questions: We aimed to accomplish two main objectives: inactivation of all pathogens, including spores; and preservation of the activity of milk components. Design/Methods: Recently, a novel high-hydrostatic pressure process has been developed by HPBioTECH. Using the same raw human milk samples, we compared the effects of this method with those of the Holder method on vegetative and spore forms of pathogens and on bioactive components (lipase activity, immunoproteins). Results: Two main microbial strains were selected: Staphylococcus aureus (as a reference for vegetative forms) and Bacillus cereus (as a reference for spores). Use of the high-hydrostatic pressure process led to microbial decontamination of 6 log for both S. aureus and B. cereus. Additionally, the bioactivity of the main components of human milk was preserved, with activities of lipase, a-lactalbumin, casein, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and sIgA of {\textasciitilde}80, 96-99, 98-100, 95-100, 93-97, and 63-64\%, respectively. Conclusions: Use of this novel high-hydrostatic pressure process to generate microbiologically safe human milk may provide important benefits for preterm infants, including improved assimilation of human milk (leading increased weight gain) and improved resistance to infections. Because 10\% of all human milk collected is contaminated by B. cereus, use of this method will also prevent waste. © 2018 Demazeau, Plumecocq, Lehours, Martin, Couëdelo and Billeaud.},

In our system, Bacillus cereus spores were artificially inoculated into Doenjang and Gochujang. Hurdle techniques used in this study were additives (3\% ethyl alcohol-0.03\% oregano extract), Joule heating (95°C for 5 min), and hydrostatic pressure (500 MPa for 5 min at 45°C). Additive-Joule (AJ) and additive-Joulepressure (AJP) treatments for Doenjang resulted in a 2.80 log and 3.74 log reduction, respectively, while treatments for Gochujang resulted in a 4.71 log and 5.60 log reduction, respectively. This suggests a high synergistic effect of Joule heating with additive treatment in Doenjang and Gochujang. A combination of hurdles such as additives, Joule heating, and hydrostatic pressure also kept Bacillus cereus spore counts low during storage at 30oC. Therefore, Bacillus cereus spores inoculated into Doenjang and Gochujang can be effectively reduced through combined treatments, including AJ or AJP.},

	abstract = {High Pressure Processing (HPP) and biopreservation can contribute to food safety by inactivation of bacterial contaminants. However these treatments are inefficient against bacterial endospores. Moreover, HPP can induce spore germination. The objective of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria strains to be used as bioprotective cultures, to control vegetative cells of spore-forming bacteria in ham after application of HPP. A collection of 63 strains of various origins was screened for their antagonistic activity against spore-forming Bacillus and Clostridium species and their ability to resist to HPP. Some safety requirements should also be considered prior to their introduction into the food chain. Hence, the selection steps included the assessment of biogenic amine production and antibiotic resistance. No strain produced histamine above the threshold detection level of 50 ppm. From the assessment of antibiotic resistance against nine antibiotics, 14 susceptible strains were kept. Antagonistic action of the 14 strains was then assessed by the well diffusion method against pathogenic or spoilage spore-forming species as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp. like botulinum, Clostridium frigidicarnis, and Clostridium algidicarnis. One Lactobacillus curvatus strain and one Lactococcus lactis strain were ultimately selected for their widest inhibitory spectrum and their potential production of bacteriocin. A Lactobacillus plantarum strain was included as control. Their resistance to HPP and ability to regrow during chilled storage was then assessed in model ham liquid medium. Treatments of pressure intensities of 400, 500, and 600 MPa, and durations of 1, 3, 6, and 10 min were applied. After treatment, cultures were incubated at 8 °C during 30 days. Inactivation curves were then fitted by using a reparameterized Weibull model whereas growth curves were modelled with a logistic model. Although the two Lactobacillus strains were more resistant than L. lactis to HPP, the latter was the only strain able to regrow following HPP. The absence of biogenic amine production of this strain after growth on diced cube cooked ham was also shown. In conclusion this L. lactis strain could be selected as representing the best candidate for a promising preservative treatment combining biopreservation and HPP to control spore-forming bacteria in cooked ham. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The effect of input power (39, 43, and 46 W) and treatment time (0 to 270 s) was fitted using the Weibull model to represent the microbial kinetic inactivation in the treated TNM. Inactivation efficacy increased with an increase in treatment time and input power. A 5.28-log reduction was achieved at 39 to 46 W without significant changes in titratable acidity, whereas no reduction in titratable acidity was observed in the pasteurized sample. The inactivation kinetics was adequately described by the Weibull model. Higher input power of 43 and 46 W and 120 s of treatment resulted in marked decreases in pH, flavonoid concentration, and antioxidant activity compared with those parameters in pasteurized TNM. Increases in total color difference and phenolic concentrations also were observed. The results indicate that these changes were caused by the immanent plasma reactive species.

The results showed enzyme activation under mild process conditions ({\textless} 120 MPa for HPH and {\textless} 400 MPa for HPP, both at 20 °C) and mostly for activity measured at non-optimum pH and temperature. When processes were carried out at 50 °C, lower activation were observed ({\textless} 18\% for HPH and {\textless} 13\% for HPP), possibly indicating that processes at 50 °C delivered enough energy to promote undesirable unfolding on lysozyme. HPH induced a greater increase in muramidase activity (29\%) than HPP (17\%), but this not reflected the antimicrobial performance of the processed lysozyme, since only HPP reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration of the lysozyme against Bacillus cereus (50\%) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (66\%). The results highlighted that each process changed differently the lysozyme muramidase and antimicrobial activity. Industrial relevance HPP and HPH are generally described as technologies able to increase the activity of several enzymes and are suggested as tools to improve the performance of commercial enzymes. The results showed that although HPP and HPH were able to increase the muramidase activity of lysozyme, improvement of the antibacterial performance was only observed for samples processed by HPP. Therefore HPP was highlighted as the better pressure process to physically modify lysozyme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The elimination of microorganisms in rice is quite difficult due to its solid phase. In this study, a new method of intervention for the inactivation of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis in rice was developed using fermented ethanol (FE) and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). Raw rice samples inoculated with Bacillus spp. were treated with 1. FE only (concentrations: 0, 10, 30, 50, and 70\%; treatment duration: 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min), 2. SC-CO2 only (temperatures: 36, 40, and 44 °C; pressure: 100, 150, and 200 bar; treatment duration: 10, 20, and 30 min) or 3. with both FE (30\% for 30 and 60 min) and SC-CO2 (36 °C, 100 bar, 10 min and 44 °C, 200 bar, 30 min). The survival of Bacillus spp. populations was assayed, as were any changes in the hardness and color of the treated rice. When rice samples were treated with the combined treatment of FE (30\%, 60 min) and SC-CO2 (200 bar, 44 °C, 30 min), Bacillus spp. were maximally reduced by approximately 5 log CFU/g. Sufficient log reduction of B. cereus (4.76 log CFU/g) and B. subtilis (4.66 log CFU/g) were also obtained with mild treatment (FE: 30\%, 30 min and SC-CO2: 100 bar, 36 °C, 10 min). The combined treatment led to beneficial changes including decrease in the hardness of cooked rice and whitening of rice (increase of lightness and decrease of yellowness) compared to that of untreated rice, resulting in an increase in perceived quality. The changes of hardness and lightness were mainly affected by FE and SC-CO2, respectively. Our results indicate that a combined treatment with FE and SC-CO2 can be successfully used for the inactivation of Bacillus spp. in rice, with simultaneous improvements in rice. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Precision and bias factors were calculated in order to validate the acceptance of predictions. These were considered within the acceptable range for vegetative cells models. The conditions to reach a maximum bacterial inactivation (within the ranges of this assay) were a pressure intensity of 593.96 MPa for 233 s.

Sensory results indicated that UHPH treatment did not produce changes in soymilk which could affect the panel perception for different UHT and UHPH soymilks and for selecting their preference. Industrial relevance Soymilk constitutes one of the food industry sectors with the highest worldwide growth and its consumption has experienced a noticeable increase in the last years. The growing consumer demand for safe products, environmentally friendly processes and high quality nutritional foods has challenged the food industry to adapt the technological processes. This tendency impacts directly on traditional technologies, like heat treatments. In this sense, UHPH technology has been applied as an alternative to those thermal treatments. This research paper presents a comparative study between soymilk treated by UHPH and by UHT to produce a product stored at room temperature for 6 months. Results showed stable levels of oxidation, high physical stability, no microbial growth and a positive trend of sensory response during the period analyzed for UHPH soymilk. Moreover, the UHPH system was designed to work at continuous flow, allowing its application in several industrial food processes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different treatment conditions on microbiological indicators of donkey milk hygiene and their evolution during shelf life at 4 and 12°C from 3 to 30 d, simulating a farm-scale pasteurization and packing system. Four treatment conditions were tested: no treatment (raw milk), pasteurization (65°C × 30 min), high-pressure processing (HPP), and pasteurization plus HPP. The microbiological quality of the raw donkey milk investigated was not optimal; our results highlight the importance of raw milk management with the need for animal hygiene management and good dairy farming practices on donkey farms to improve handling procedures. The raw milk treated with HPP alone showed visible alterations with flocks, making the milk unfit for sale. The microbiological risk posed by consumption of raw donkey milk was significantly reduced by heat treatment but farm-scale packing systems cannot guarantee an extended shelf life. In contrast, the pasteurization plus HPP treatment was the most effective method to maintain microbiological milk quality. Microflora growth had little effect on pH in donkey milk: pH values were significantly different only between raw milk and pasteurized and pasteurized plus HPP milk stored at 12°C for 3 d. Alkaline phosphatase activity and furosine could be used as indicators of proper pasteurization and thermal processing in donkey milk. Moreover, the presence and growth of Bacillus cereus in the case of thermal abuse hamper the wide-scale marketing of donkey milk due to the potential consequences for sensitive consumers and therefore further tests with time/temperature/high-pressure protocols associated with B. cereus are needed. Finally, our study shows that an HPP treatment of pasteurized milk after packing extends the shelf life of donkey milk and assures its microbial criteria up to 30 d if properly stored at 4°C until opening; therefore, combined heat treatment and storage strategies are recommended to enhance the shelf life of donkey milk. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.},

We accurately documented nine separate anecdotes, which include various medicinal uses (for the treatment of colds, fever, influenza, stomach pain, diarrhoea, back pain, chest ailments, high blood pressure and tuberculosis). The novel data also includes seven previously unrecorded vernacular names, namely flip-se-bos, inflammasiebos, pylbos, dassiebos, dassiepisbos, perdebos and boegabos. Since the species is poorly known, its general morphology, leaf anatomy and essential oil composition were studied. Oil is produced in secretory ducts along the midribs below the main vascular bundle; secretory trichomes are also present on the leaf surface. The oil is relatively complex and contains a combination of sabinene, myrcene, β-caryophyllene and bicyclogermacrene as main compounds with smaller amounts of limonene, p-cymene, tetradecane, pentadecane, terpinen-4-ol and δ-cadinene. Dichloromethane extracts exhibited antibacterial activity (especially against Bacillus cereus) at MIC values as low as 1.0. mg/ml.

In the first step, milk protein concentrate was produced from ultra-heat-treated skimmed milk by removing milk serumas permeate. A tubular ceramic-made membrane with filtration area 5 × 10-3 m2 and pore size 5 nm, placed in a cross-flow membrane house, was adopted. Superior operational strategy in filtration process was herein: trans-membrane pressure 3 bar, retention flow rate 100 L·h-1, and implementation of a static turbulence promoter within the tubular membrane. Milk with concentrated proteins from retentate side was treated with the different concentrations of trypsin, ranging from 0.008-0.064 g·L-1 in individual batch-mode operations at temperature 40 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, inactivation of trypsin in reaction was done at a temperature of 70 °C for 30 min of incubation. Antioxidant capacity in enzyme-treated liquid milk protein concentrate was measured with the Ferric reducing ability of plasma assay. The reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme activity by enzyme-treated liquid milk protein concentrate was measured with substrate (Abz-FRK(Dnp)-P) and recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme. The antibacterial activity of enzyme-treated liquid milk protein concentrate towards Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus was tested. Antioxidant capacity, anti-angiotensin converting enzyme activity, and antibacterial activity were increased with the increase of trypsin concentration in proteolytic reaction. Immune-reactive proteins in enzyme-treated liquid milk protein concentrate were identified with clinically proved milk positive pooled human serum and peroxidase-labelled anti-human Immunoglobulin E. The reduction of allergenicity in milk protein concentrate was enzyme dose-dependent. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Apolipoprotein (APO) genes represent a large family of genes encoding various binding proteins associated with plasma lipid transport. Due to the long divergence history, it remains to be confirmed whether these genes evolved from a common ancestor through gene duplication and original function, and how this evolution occurred. In this study, based on the phylogenetic tree, sequence alignment, motifs, and evolutionary analysis of gene synteny and collinearity, APOA, APOC, and APOE in higher vertebrates may have a common ancestor, lamprey serum apolipoprotein LAL1 or LAL2, which traces back to 360 million years ago. Moreover, the results of immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry show that LAL2 is primarily distributed in the liver, kidney, and blood leukocytes of lampreys, and specifically localized in the cytoplasm of liver cells and leukocytes, as well as secreted into sera. Surface plasmon resonance technology demonstrates that LAL2 colocalizes to breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) or chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562) associated with lamprey immune protein (LIP) and further enhances the killing effect of LIP on tumor cells. In addition, using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and western blot methods, we found that the relative mRNA and protein expression of lal2 in lamprey leukocytes and sera increased significantly at different times after stimulating with Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio anguillarum, and Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Moreover, LAL2 was found to recognize and bind to gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and play an important role in the antibacterial process. All in all, our data reveals a long, complex evolutionary history for apolipoprotein genes under different selection pressures, confirms the immune effect of LAL2 in lamprey sera against pathogens, and lays the foundation for further research regarding biological functions of lamprey immune systems. © Copyright © 2020 Han, Han, Wen, Pang and Li.},

Here we report the effect of eleven plant essential oils on the nutrient- A nd HP-induced germination of spores of a group VI psychrotolerant Bacillus cereus strain. Ten oils partially inhibited nutrient-induced germination. These oils also inhibited HP-induced germination, but some inhibited only germination at moderate (200 MPa) pressure and others only at very high (600 MPa) pressure. Inhibition of spore germination by essential oils may have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of spore inactivation by HP at moderate temperatures, and this should be taken into account when designing combined processes. Essential oil from carrot seed did not inhibit nutrient or HP germination although it showed growth inhibitory properties, and essential oils with these properties may therefore open interesting perspectives in combination treatments with HP. Industrial relevance HP treatment is an alternative processing technique that preserves a better balance of food quality and microbiological safety as compared to thermal processing. While most vegetative bacteria are efficiently inactivated by HP, inactivation of spores is inefficient. At moderate temperature, spore inactivation proceeds in a two-step process in which spores first germinate and are subsequently inactivated. The combination with natural antimicrobials is a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of HP processing because it exerts a synergistic effect on inactivation of vegetative bacteria. However, the current work is one of the first to document the effect of essential oils on the HP-induced germination of spores. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The concentration of spores in model cheeses was approximately 6-log10 cfu/g of cheese. Cheeses were vacuum packed and stored at 8°C. All samples except controls were submitted to a germination cycle of 60 MPa at 30°C for 210 min, to a vegetative cells destruction cycle of 300 or 400 MPa at 30°C for 15 min, or to both treatments. Bacillus cereus counts were measured 24 h and 15 d after HHP treatment. The combination of both cycles improved the efficiency of the whole treatment. When the second pressure-cycle was of 400 MPa, the highest inactivation (2.4 ± 0.1-log10 cfu/g) was obtained with the presence of nisin (1.56 mg/L of milk), whereas lysozyme (22.4 mg/L of milk) did not increase sensitivity of the spores to HHP. For nisin (0.05 and 1.56 mg/L of milk), no significant differences were found between counts at 24 h and 15 d after treatment. Considering that mesophilic spore counts usually range from 2.6 to 3.0 log10 cfu/ml in raw milk, HHP at mild temperatures with the addition of nisin may be useful for improving safety and preservation of soft curd cheeses made from raw milk.},

For this purpose, freshly grown B. cereus and Escherichia coli were inoculated on the lettuce leaves prior to treatments. Combination of EP (at a concentration of around 10 μL dm−3) with APP was more effective on inactivation of bacteria when compared to EP and APP treatments separately, reducing the total viable counts nearly 5 CFU cm−2 compared to control. The use of EP and APP together led to around 2.5 more log (CFU cm−2) reductions when compared to the sole use of EP and APP separately. B. cereus cells were almost three times more susceptible to APP treatment than E. coli. Growth inhibition increased after storing the treated samples at 25 °C by around 2.5 and 1.5 logs for E. coli and B. cereus, respectively, compared to 6 °C. APP treatment time (30 and 60 s) and storage time (1 and 3 days) did not significantly affect the inactivation levels. E. coli was more effectively inactivated after EP + O2 treatment followed by storage at 25 °C. The highest level of inactivation was noted as nearly 5 log reductions. Slight differences in the peak intensities of FTIR spectra of treated lettuce samples were observed compared to control, indicating slight modifications on the chemical structure on the lettuce leaves. Industrial relevance: The microbial load influences the quality, safety, and shelf-life of fresh produce such as lettuce. Current decontamination techniques may cause some unwanted effects such as odor, discoloration, and decreased nutritional value. This study shows that the use of the APP-EP hurdle represents a promising strategy to improve the decontamination efficiency and hence, enhance the shelf-life of freshly cut vegetables. The data obtained contribute to a better understanding of APP-EP-induced effects on the quality and shelf-life of fresh-cut lettuce and provide a scientific basis for industrial implementation. © 2021},

Pork slices were marinated in brine with no sodium nitrite at 4 °C for 16 h and treated by APP for 0, 20, 40, and 60 min, respectively. The sample marinated in the brine with sodium nitrite (100 ppm) was also prepared. Then, all samples were dried. As APP treatment time increased, the a⁎ value (redness), nitrosoheme pigment content, and residual nitrite content increased, while lipid oxidation decreased (all P {\textless} 0.05). Similar quality properties, particularly color, were observed in jerky applied by APP for 40 min compared to jerky made with sodium nitrite. After inoculation of marinated pork with Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, the amounts of both pathogens in jerky applied by APP for 40 and 60 min were significantly lower than in jerky made with sodium nitrite. Consequently, APP can be applied for manufacturing potentially safer pork jerky without added sodium nitrite. Industrial relevance: The global interest in sodium nitrite substitute for meat products manufacturing has considerably grown for years because consumer's demand of foods labeled “natural” and “chemical-free” has been increasing. In general, APP is recognized as a novel non-thermal food processing technology that uses energetic, reactive species to inactivate microbes on various foods. Recently, meat curing system involving direct APP treatment was proposed. The present study tried to apply APP to manufacturing pork jerky without using sodium nitrite. As a result, similar quality properties, particularly color, were observed in jerky applied by APP compared to jerky made with sodium nitrite. Application of APP also improved the microbiological safety of pork jerky. Therefore, APP can be applied for manufacturing potentially safer pork jerky by inactivation of heat-resistant pathogens without added sodium nitrite. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In this context, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light at 254 nm on reducing bacterial spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus cereus at two stages of orange juice production. To simulate fruit disinfection before processing, the orange peel was artificially inoculated with each of the bacterial spores and submitted to UV-C light (97.8–100.1 W/m2) with treatment times between 3 s and 10 min. The obtained product, the orange juice, was also tested by exposing the artificially inoculated juice to UV-C light (100.9–107.9 W/m2) between 5 and 60 min. A three-minute treatment (18.0 kJ/m2) reduced spore numbers on orange peel around 2 log units, while more than 45 min (278.8 kJ/m2) were needed to achieve the same reduction in orange juice for all evaluated bacterial spores. As raw fruits are the main source of bacterial spores in fruit juices, reducing bacterial spores on fruit peels could help fruit juice processors to enhance the microbiological quality and safety of fruit juices. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Proper elimination of bacterial endospores in foods and food processing environment is challenging because of their extreme resistance to various stresses. Often, sporicidal treatments prove insufficient to eradicate the contaminating endospore population as a whole, and might therefore serve as a selection pressure for enhanced endospore resistance. In the sporeforming Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus weihenstephanensis is an important food spoilage organism and potential cereulide producing pathogen, due to its psychrotolerant growth ability at 7 °C. Although the endospores of B. weihenstephanensis are generally less heat resistant compared to their mesophilic or thermotolerant relatives, our data now show that non-emetic B. weihenstephanensis strain LMG 18989T can readily and reproducibly evolve to acquire much enhanced endospore heat resistance. In fact, one of the B. weihenstephanensis mutants from directed evolution by wet heat in this study yielded endospores displaying a {\textgreater} 4-fold increase in D-value at 91 °C compared to the parental strain. Moreover, these mutant endospores retained their superior heat resistance even when sporulation was performed at 10 °C. Interestingly, increased endospore heat resistance did not negatively affect the vegetative growth capacities of the evolved mutants at lower (7 °C) and upper (37 °C) growth temperature boundaries, indicating that the correlation between cardinal growth temperatures and endospore heat resistance which is observed among bacterial sporeformers is not necessarily causal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

SC-CO2 treatment was tested using various conditions, such as pressure treatment (10-30MPa), temperature (35-60°C), and time (10-120min). B. cereus vegetative cells in the biofilm were completely inactivated by treatment with SC-CO2 at 10MPa and at 35°C for 5min. However, SC-CO2 alone did not inactivate spores in biofilm even after the treatment time was extended to 120min. When ethanol was used as a cosolvent with SC-CO2 in the SC-CO2 treatment using only 2-10ml of ethanol in 100ml of SC-CO2 vessel for 60-90min of treatment time at 10MPa and 60°C, B. cereus spores in the biofilm were found to be completely inactivated in the colony-forming test. We also assessed the viability of SC-CO2-treated bacterial spores and vegetative cells in the biofilm by staining with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide. The membrane integrity of the vegetative cells was completely lost, while the integrity of the membrane was still maintained in most spores. However, when SC-CO2 along with ethanol was used, both vegetative cells and spores lost their membrane integrity, indicating that the use of ethanol as a cosolvent with SC-CO2 is efficient in inactivating the bacterial spores in the biofilm. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The aim of this study was to find and validate an alternative methodology for processing breast milk to increase its availability for newborn babies and reduce the financial loss associated with discarding milk that has become microbiologically positive. We prepared two series of breast milk samples inoculated with the Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) strain to verify the effectiveness of two high-pressure treatments: (1) 350 MPa/5 min/38 °C in four cycles and (2) cumulative pressure of 350 MPa/20 min/38 °C. We found that the use of pressure in cycles was statistically more effective than cumulative pressure. It reduced the number of spores by three to four orders of magnitude. We verified that the method was reproducible. The routine use of this method could lead to an increased availability of milk for newborn babies, and at the same time, reduce the amount of wasted milk. In addition, high-pressure treatment preserves the nutritional quality of milk. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The advantage of using high pressure (HP) cycling treatment compared with continuous HP treatment was investigated for the inactivation of bacterial spores. The effects of parameters such as pulse number, pressure level, treatment temperature, compression and decompression rates, and time between pulses were evaluated. For this purpose, Bacillus subtilis and B. cereus spores (108 and 106 CFU/mL respectively) were suspended in 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, tryptone salt (TS) buffer solution, or infant milk and treated by HP cycling at 300–400 MPa, at 38–60 °C, for 1–5 pulses. Pressure cycling reduced the number of viable spores by 1.8 and 5.9 log respectively for B. subtilis and B. cereus species. Continuous HP treatments were performed at the same pressure and temperature for similar treatment durations. Our results showed that the spore inactivation ratio was correlated with the cumulative exposure time to pressure rather than to effects of the cycling process. Greater spore inactivation caused by HP cycling was observed only when faster compression and decompression rates were applied, probably due to adiabatic heating. A three-step kinetic model was developed, which seemed to support our hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of inactivation by pressure cycling and continuous HP treatments. Industrial relevance: The resistance of bacterial spores to HP limits the industrial applications to refrigerated food products. In this study, we investigated the use of pressure cycling as a means to improve spore baroinactivation at moderate temperatures (T {\textless} 60 °C). We showed that cycling pressure does not significantly increase bacterial spore inactivation in comparable treatment duration, but certainly increases material fatigue in HP vessels. Thus, under moderate temperature, cycling pressure treatment is not industrially relevant. © 2021},

Kinetic inactivation parameters were estimated with linear and nonlinear models. The potential recovery of injured bacteria was also evaluated during storage of the treated product for 4 weeks at 4 and 25°C. Depending on the process temperature, a 600-MPa treatment inactivated spores by 2.2 to 3.4 log during the 30-s pressure come-up time, and to below the detection limit after 4- to 8-min pressure-holding times. In contrast, a 180-min treatment time was required to inactivate the spores to an undetectable level at 0.1 MPa and 85°C. The decimal reduction time of spores inactivated by combined pressure- heat treatment ranged from 1.08 to 2.36 min, while it was 34.6 min at 85°C under atmospheric conditions. The nonlinear Weibull model scale factor increased, and was inversely related to the decimal reduction time, and the shape factor decreased with increasing pressure or temperature. The recovery of injured spores was influenced by the extent of pressure-holding time and process temperature.

	abstract = {B. cereus strain (CECF 148) was used as a model system in the study of the behaviour of bacillus under high pressure, at temperatures over and below 0 °C and with ascorbic acid added to the culture. Three different assays were carried out in the present experiment. The first assay was performed to observe how B. cereus reacted to pressure shift freezing (PSF) treatment at different subzero temperatures (-8, -12, -20 and -17 °C) and pressures (120, 150, 210 and 350 MPa) in their vegetative form. In the second assay, we observed how different concentrations of ascorbic acid (1, 2, 5 and 20 mM) added to the growing brought decreased B. cereus on its vegetative form. Finally, we tried to inactivate the vegetative and spore form of B. cereus under pressure of 210 MPa at room (20 °C) (HP) and at subzero (-20 °C) (PSF) temperatures, in presence of ascorbic acid (20 mM), added to the growing culture (TSB). The results confirmed that pressures of 210 and 350 MPa at low temperatures (-20 and -17 °C) in the PSF treatment were not enough to inactivate bacillus and only about 10\% of B. cereus at the assayed conditions (350 MPa at -17 °C) lost its growth capacity. The presence of ascorbic acid reduced the amount of B. cereus. The initial amount of B. cereus in the vegetative form was 10 8 to 109 cfu/mL. After HP (210 MPa at 20 °C) and PSF (210 MPa at -20 °C) treatments, the amount of B. cereus decreased by 4 and 2 logarithmic units, respectively. However, in both treatments, the presence of ascorbic acid (20 mM concentration) reduced the B. cereus growth capacity in about 5 logarithmic units. The presence of ascorbic acid in the spore form decreased the amount of B. cereus only by 2 logarithmic units, but without the antioxidant, the values remained close to control.

	abstract = {Enterocin AS-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus. It contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The conformation of enterocin AS-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. Enterocin AS-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on Gram-positive bacteria. Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. Eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. This cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. Microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. Enterocin AS-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. The potential applications of enterocin AS-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). The efficacy of enterocin AS-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high hydrostatic pressure. © 2014 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aims: The aim of this work was to investigate the germination and inactivation of spores of Bacillus species in buffer and milk subjected to high pressure (HP) and nisin. Methods and Results: Spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus suspended in milk or buffer were treated at 100 or 500 MPa at 40°C with or without 500 IU ml-1 of nisin. Treatment at 500 MPa resulted in high levels of germination (4 log units) of B. subtilis spores in both milk and buffer; this increased to {\textgreater}6 logs by applying a second cycle of pressure. Viability of B. subtilis spores in milk and buffer was reduced by 2.5 logs by cycled HP, while the addition of nisin (500 IU ml-1) prior to HP treatment resulted in log reductions of 5.7 and 5.9 in phosphate buffered saline and milk, respectively. Physical damage of spores of B. subtilis following HP was apparent using scanning electron microscopy. Treating four strains of B. cereus at 500 MPa for 5 min twice at 40°C in the presence of 500 IU ml-1 nisin proved less effective at inactivating the spores of these isolates compared with B. subtilis and some strain-to-strain variability was observed. Conclusions: Although high levels of germination of Bacillus spores could be achieved by combining HP and nisin, complete inactivation was not achieved using the aforementioned treatments. Significance and Impact of the Study: Combinations of HP treatment and nisin may be an appealing alternative to heat pasteurization of milk. © 2008 The Authors.},

Bacillus cereus vegetative cells (1×10 8 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) were inoculated in LWE-SM beverages with or without natural antimicrobial supplements: flavonol rich-cocoa powder (cocoanOX 12\%, CCX) (700 ppm), vanillin (700 ppm), anise (700 ppm), and cinnamon (700ppm). B. cereus cells were maintained at 10°C for 10 days in the different beverages to test the bacteriostatic or inhibitory effect of the aforementioned ingredients. Beverages were treated with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology and stored at 10°C for 15 days after treatment. All natural antimicrobials reduced the Phmx values and increased the lag phase time of B. cereus, and Gompertz growth curves showed different inhibitory effects depending on the substance. The maximum inhibitory effect (1.330 log cycle reduction) was achieved in LWE-SM-cinnamon-supplemented beverage. The maximum inactivation achieved by HHP in LWE-SM beverage was a reduction of around 3.89 ± 0.25 log cycles at 300 MPa for 12 minutes. When supplemented beverages were treated under the same conditions, enhanced inactivation levels were achieved. This increased inactivation can be attributed to a synergistic effect when the LWE-SM was supplemented with flavonol-rich cocoa powder, cinnamon, and vanillin. The maximum synergistic effect was observed in LWE-SM-CCX-supplemented beverage. During the refrigerated storage of B. cereus HHP-treated cells in beverages to which antimicrobials had been added, the inhibitory effect was dependent on the previously applied pressure level. © Mary Ann Liebert.

	abstract = {The growing world population and the need to reduce the environmental impact of food production drive the exploration of novel protein sources. Insects are being cultivated, harvested, and processed to be applied in animal and human nutrition. The inherent microbial contamination of insect matrices requires risk management and decontamination strategies. Thermal sterilization results in unfavorable cooking effects and oxidation of fatty acids. The present study demonstrates the risk management in Acheta domesticus (home cricket) powder with a low-energy (8.7–22.0 mW/cm2, 5 min) semi-direct surface micro discharge (SMD)–cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP). At a plasma power density lower than 22 mW/cm2, no degradation of triglycerides (TG) or increased free fatty acids (FFA) content was detected. For mesophilic bacteria, 1.6 ± 0.1 log10 reductions were achieved, and for Enterobacteriaceae, there were close to 1.9 ± 0.2 log10 reductions in a layer of powder. Colonies of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium were identified via the mass spectral fingerprint analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). The spores of these Bacillus strains resisted to a plasma power density of 22 mW/cm2. Additional inactivation effects at non-thermal, practically non-oxidative conditions are supposed for low-intensity plasma treatments combined with the powder’s fluidization. © Copyright © 2021 Pina-Pérez, Rodrigo, Ellert and Beyrer.},

	abstract = {High Power ultrasound can be used to alter physicochemical properties and improve the quality of foods during processing due to a number of mechanical, chemical, and biochemical effects arising from acoustic cavitation. Cavitation creates pressure waves that inactivate microbes and de-agglomerate bacterial clusters or release ascospores from fungal asci. Bacterial and heat resistant fungal spores' inactivation is a great challenge in food preservation due to their ability to survive after conventional food processing, causing food-borne diseases or spoilage. In this work, a showcase of application of high power ultrasound combined with heat or thermosonication, to inactivate bacterial spores i.e. Bacillus cereus spores in beef slurry and fungal spores i.e. Neosartorya fischeri ascospores in apple juice was presented and compared with thermal processing. Faster inactivation was achieved at higher TS (24 KHz, 0.33 W/g or W/mL) temperatures. Around 2 log inactivation was obtained for B. cereus spores after1 min (70 °C) and N. fischeri ascospores after 30 min (75 °C). Thermal treatments caused {\textless}1 log in B. Cereus after 2 min (70 °C) and no inactivation in N. Fischeri ascospores after 30 min (80 °C). In conclusion, temperature plays a significant role for TS spore inactivation and TS was more effective than thermal treatment alone. The mould spores were more resistant than the bacterial spores. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The enzymes were exposed at 20 °C for 5, 15, 30 and 60 min to pressures of 200, 400 and 600 MPa. In contrast to vegetative forms of microorganisms, the microbial proteases tested could not be inactivated efficiently under the selected conditions.

The proteases of Aeromonas (A.) hydrophila and B. subtilis can be classified as pressure resistant up to 400 MPa with a reduced activity of 10 \%, whereas the proteases of B. cereus and a-chymotrypsin can be evaluated as pressure sensitive to only 200 MPa. The relatively high residual activity of the studied enzymes may represent a source of spoilage and should be taken into consideration for shelf life determinations of HP-treated products. © M. \& H.

Microbiological and sensory analyses, pH and emulsion stability of each sample were determined. At 7 °C, B. cereus spores in HP and TC treated formula were reduced by 2.4 and 3.1 log, respectively. At 23 °C, the highest inactivation was observed with TC alone and TC combined with HP, by 2.1 log. Overall, HP showed the highest inactivation rate when combined with TC, confirming the synergistic antimicrobial effect of TC and HP. Remarkable deformation and damage in both B. cereus vegetative cells and spores were observed by transmission electron microscopy after the application of HP and TC. Although TC exhibited a cinnamon-like taste, overall sensory attributes were not significantly different than the control samples. These results suggest that TC and HP could be incorporated in infant formula as a natural intervention to replace the synthetic preservatives and/or enhance the microbiological safety and shelf-life. © 2018},

Breast milk is better than donated breast milk (DHM), but if breast milk is not available, DHM is distributed by the Human Milk Bank (HMB). Raw Human Milk is better than HMB milk, but it may contain dangerous germs, so it is usually milk pasteurized by a Holder treatment (62.5◦ C 30 min). However, Holder does not destroy all germs, and in particular, in 7\% to 14\%, the spores of Bacillus cereus are found, and it also destroys the microbiota, lipase BSSL and immune proteins. Another technique, High-Temperature Short Time (HTST 72◦ C, 5–15 s), has been tried, which is imperfect, does not destroy Bacillus cereus, but degrades the lipase and partially the immune proteins. Therefore, techniques that do not treat by temperature have been proposed. For more than 25 years, high hydrostatic pressure has been tried with pressures from 100 to 800 MPa. Pressures above 400 MPa can alter the immune proteins without destroying the Bacillus cereus. We propose a High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) with four pressure cycles ranging from 50–150 MPa to promote Bacillus cereus germination and a 350 MPa Pressure that destroys 106 Bacillus cereus and retains 80–100\% of lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and 64\% of IgAs. Other HHP techniques are being tested. We propose a literature review of these techniques. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Aerobic bacteria, B. cereus, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and molds and yeasts were detected as contaminants in the seeds. All the detected microorganisms of the seeds were reduced in the range of 1.3-2.1 log CFU/g on treatment using the CDPJ for 3 min. The microbial inactivation patterns were better explained by pseudo-first-order kinetics. The CDPJ seed treatment for up to 2 min was found to have beneficial effects on seed germination rate and growth of seedlings. Sprouts grown from the CDPJ-treated seeds exhibited no significant changes in the levels of moisture (mean range 84.76-87.18 \%), reducing sugars (0.776-0.796 \%), total phenolic content (5.69-5.95 µg GAL/g) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (62.63-64.78 \%) compared to untreated controls. Sensory characteristics of pak choi sprouts grown from the plasma-treated (up to 2 min) seeds were not significantly different from controls. © 2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Non-thermal methods are suggested for decontamination of spices to preserve safety and quality of the products. In this study, effects of atmospheric pressure floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge plasma were investigated on red pepper powder, compared to gamma irradiation. Material and methods: To achieve the optimum time of treatment for decontamination, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Aspergillus flavus as microorganisms in red pepper were exposed to atmospheric pressure floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge plasma for 10, 20 and 30 min and the structural changes in microorganisms were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and DNA measurement following exposure. The red pepper was exposed to plasma for 20 min (optimum time) and 10 KGy gamma irradiation. Microbial count, color measurement and sensory evaluation of the samples were assessed before and after treatments. Results and conclusion: Results indicated that the density of surviving bacterial strains decreased when time of exposure increased and this decrease was significant after 10 min (P≤0.05). The complete decontamination was carried out within 20 min. The deformation of cells and destruction of cell wall structures were seen in bacteria and mold following exposure. Data revealed that cold floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge plasma for 20 min inactivated red pepper microorganisms as well as gamma irradiation. As a conclusion, floating-electrode dielectric-barrier discharge plasma is an appropriate method to decontaminate the red pepper powder (regardless of color change) and can replace traditional methods without changes in the product quality and taste. © National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute.},

	abstract = {Background: Human milk banks have a pivotal role in provide optimal food for those infants who are not fully breastfeed, by allowing human milk from donors to be collected, processed and appropriately distributed. Donor human milk (DHM) is usually preserved by Holder pasteurization, considered to be the gold standard to ensure the microbiology safety and nutritional value of milk. However, as stated by the European Milk Banking Association (EMBA) there is a need to implement the improvement of the operating procedure of human milk banks including preserving and storing techniques. Aim: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of the selected new combination of methods for preserving donor human milk in comparison with thermal treatment (Holder pasteurization). Methods: We assessed (1) the concentration of bioactive components (insulin, adiponectin, leptin, activity of pancreatic lipase, and hepatocyte growth factor) and (2) microbiological safety in raw and pasteurized, high-pressure processed and lyophilization human breast milk. Results: The combination of two techniques, high-pressure processing and freeze-drying, showed the best potential for preserving the nutritional value of human milk and were evaluated for microbiological safety. Microbiological safety assessment excluded the possibility of using freeze-drying alone for human milk sample preservation. However, it can be used as a method for long-term storage of milk samples, which have previously been preserved via other processes. Conclusion: The results show that high-pressure treatment is the best method for preservation that ensures microbiological safety and biological activity but subsequent freeze-drying allowed long-term storage without loss of properties. © 2021 by the authors.

The HPP-70 °C process enhanced the B. cereus spore thermal inactivation in beef slurry, resulting in 4.9 log reductions after 20 min vs. 0.5 log for thermal processing. Then, the effect of temperature at 600 MPa on the spore inactivation up to 40 min was studied, and the log survivors vs. time were modeled. Weibull model was appropriate to characterize the inactivation. Increasing the HPP temperature from 38 to 70 °C, increased the spore inactivation in beef slurry up to 3 log. Lastly, the thermal inactivation of the spores was investigated. The spore thermal inactivation was linear and first order kinetic parameters were determined.

	abstract = {A hallmark of Listeria (L.) monocytogenes pathogenesis is bacterial escape from maturing entry vacuoles, which is required for rapid bacterial replication in the host cell cytoplasm and cell-to-cell spread. The bacterial transcriptional activator PrfA controls expression of key virulence factors that enable exploitation of this intracellular niche. The transcriptional activity of PrfA within infected host cells is controlled by allosteric coactivation. Inhibitory occupation of the coactivator site has been shown to impair PrfA functions, but consequences of PrfA inhibition for L. monocytogenes infection and pathogenesis are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of PrfA with a small molecule inhibitor occupying the coactivator site at 2.0 Å resolution. Using molecular imaging and infection studies in macrophages, we demonstrate that PrfA inhibition prevents the vacuolar escape of L. monocytogenes and enables extensive bacterial replication inside spacious vacuoles. In contrast to previously described spacious Listeria-containing vacuoles, which have been implicated in supporting chronic infection, PrfA inhibition facilitated progressive clearance of intracellular L. monocytogenes from spacious vacuoles through lysosomal degradation. Thus, inhibitory occupation of the PrfA coactivator site facilitates formation of a transient intravacuolar L. monocytogenes replication niche that licenses macrophages to effectively eliminate intracellular bacteria. Our findings encourage further exploration of PrfA as a potential target for antimicrobials and highlight that intra-vacuolar residence of L. monocytogenes in macrophages is not inevitably tied to bacterial persistence.},

Current approaches to this require resource-intensive screening of large libraries of lead-like or fragment molecules. Here, we describe an efficient and effective experimental approach to mapping interaction sites using a set of halogenated compounds expressing paired hydrogen-bonding motifs, termed FragLites. The FragLites identify productive drug-like interactions, which are identified sensitively and unambiguously by X-ray crystallography, exploiting the anomalous scattering of the halogen substituent. This mapping of protein interaction surfaces provides an assessment of druggability and can identify efficient start points for the de novo design of hit molecules incorporating the interacting motifs. The approach is illustrated by mapping cyclin-dependent kinase 2, which successfully identifies orthosteric and allosteric sites. The hits were rapidly elaborated to develop efficient lead-like molecules. Hence, the approach provides a new method of identifying ligand sites, assessing tractability and discovering new leads.},

	abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to adapt to changing environments challenges the prediction of their history-dependent behavior. Cellular biomarkers that are quantitatively correlated to stress adaptive behavior will facilitate our ability to predict the impact of these adaptive traits. Here, we present a framework for identifying cellular biomarkers for mild stress induced enhanced microbial robustness towards lethal stresses. Several candidate-biomarkers were selected by comparing the genome-wide transcriptome profiles of our model-organism Bacillus cereus upon exposure to four mild stress conditions (mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress). These candidate-biomarkers—a transcriptional regulator (activating general stress responses), enzymes (removing reactive oxygen species), and chaperones and proteases (maintaining protein quality)—were quantitatively determined at transcript, protein and/or activity level upon exposure to mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress for various time intervals. Both unstressed and mild stress treated cells were also exposed to lethal stress conditions (severe heat, acid and oxidative stress) to quantify the robustness advantage provided by mild stress pretreatment. To evaluate whether the candidate-biomarkers could predict the robustness enhancement towards lethal stress elicited by mild stress pretreatment, the biomarker responses upon mild stress treatment were correlated to mild stress induced robustness towards lethal stress. Both short- and long-term biomarkers could be identified of which their induction levels were correlated to mild stress induced enhanced robustness towards lethal heat, acid and/or oxidative stress, respectively, and are therefore predictive cellular indicators for mild stress induced enhanced robustness. The identified biomarkers are among the most consistently induced cellular components in stress responses and ubiquitous in biology, supporting extrapolation to other microorganisms than B. cereus. Our quantitative, systematic approach provides a framework to search for these biomarkers and to evaluate their predictive quality in order to select promising biomarkers that can serve to early detect and predict adaptive traits.},

Stress-induced enhanced robustness complicates the predictability of microbial inactivation. Using psychrotolerant Bacillus weihenstephanensis strain KBAB4 as a model, we investigated the impact of the culturing temperature on mild-oxidative-stress-induced (cross-)protection toward multiple stresses, including severe oxidative, heat, and acid stresses. Culturing at a refrigeration temperature (7°C) compared to the optimal growth temperature (30°C) affected both the robustness level of B. weihenstephanensis and the oxidative stress adaptive response. Scavengers of reactive oxygen species have a crucial role in adaptation to oxidative stresses, and this points to a possible predictive role in mild-oxidative-stress-induced robustness. Therefore, the catalase activity was determined upon mild oxidative stress treatment and was demonstrated to be significantly correlated with the robustness level of mild-stress-treated cells toward severe oxidative and heat stresses but not toward severe acid stress for cells grown at both refrigeration and optimal temperatures. The quantified correlations supported the predictive quality of catalase activity as a biomarker and also underlined that the predictive quality is stress specific. Biomarkers that are able to predict stress-induced enhanced robustness can be used to better understand stress adaptation mechanisms and might allow the design of effective combinations of hurdles to control microbial behavior.},

	abstract = {Background
Food legislation in the European Union and elsewhere includes both hazard- and risk-based approaches for ensuring safety. In hazard-based approaches, simply the presence of a potentially harmful agent at a detectable level in food is used as a basis for legislation and/or risk management action. Risk-based approaches allow consideration of exposure in assessing whether there may be unacceptable risks to health.
Scope and approach
The advantages and disadvantages of hazard- and risk-based approaches for ensuring the safety of food chemicals, allergens, ingredients and microorganisms were explored at an ILSI Europe workshop.
Key findings and conclusions
It was concluded that both types of approach have their place, depending on the context. However, problems can arise when both types of approach are used in regulation by separate agencies that address different aspects of the same agent/substance present in food. This separation of decision-making can result in hazard-based restrictions on marketing and use, whereas risk-based assessments for those exposed show there is reasonable certainty no harm will result. This in turn can lead to contradictory, confusing and ultimately unnecessary actions. Use of hazard-based approaches for foods also means that comparisons with benefits for nutrition and food security cannot be undertaken. This has the potential to lead to bias in the overall conclusions of regulators and risk managers, who may not have been presented with the benefits of particular foods. The value of risk-based approaches is becoming increasingly recognised.},

	abstract = {Background
Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter are the major bacterial pathogens associated with foodborne diseases and their inactivation is fundamental to ensure microbiologically safe products. Although efficient in generating safe foods with proper shelf-lives, pasteurization and commercial sterilization may result in numerous nutritional and sensory changes in foods. To address these disadvantages, mild processing methods (i.e., processing technologies for food preservation that apply mild temperature; {\textless}40 °C) aiming to destroy microbial food contaminants have been developed.
Scope and approach
This review emphasizes the main applications of mild technologies aiming to the inactivation of the four main pathogenic bacteria of relevance for food safety as well as their mechanisms of action.
Key findings and conclusions
Mild processing technologies such as high pressure processing, ultrasounds, pulsed electric fields, UV-light, and atmospheric cold plasma may serve, in some conditions, as useful alternatives to commercial sterilization and pasteurization aiming to destroy foodborne pathogens. Each of these mild technologies has a specific mode of microbial inactivation and their knowledge is of foremost importance in the design and practical application aiming to produce high quality and safe foods. This is necessary to ensure that mild technologies are highly advantageous in comparison to conventional technologies not only for preservation of nutritional and sensorial aspects of foods but also to ensure their safety throughout shelf-life.},

We probed the ability of fluoro-phenyl-styrene-sulfonamide (FPSS), a small-molecule inhibitor of σ(B) activity in Listeria monocytogenes, to inhibit σ(B) activity in B. subtilis through perturbation of signal transduction cascades under various stress conditions. FPSS inhibited the activation of σ(B) in response to multiple categories of stress known to induce σ(B) activity in B. subtilis. Specifically, FPSS prevented the induction of σ(B) activity in response to energy stress, including entry into stationary phase, phosphate limitation, and azide stress. FPSS also inhibited chill induction of σ(B) activity in a ΔrsbV strain, suggesting that FPSS does not exclusively target the RsbU and RsbP phosphatases or the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV, all of which contribute to posttranslational regulation of σ(B) activity. Genetic and biochemical experiments, including artificial induction of σ(B), analysis of the phosphorylation state of the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV, and in vitro transcription assays, indicate that while FPSS does not bind directly to σ(B) to inhibit activity, it appears to prevent the release of B. subtilis σ(B) from its anti-sigma factor RsbW.},

	doi = {10.1128/AEM.00397-21},
	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and intracellular pathogen that responds to stress using predominantly the alternative sigma factor SigB. Stress is sensed by a multiprotein complex, the stressosome, extensively studied in bacteria grown in nutrient media. Following signal perception, the stressosome triggers a phosphorylation cascade that releases SigB from its anti-sigma factor. Whether the stressosome is activated during the intracellular infection is unknown. Here, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of stressosome proteins in L. monocytogenes located inside epithelial cells following their immunodetection in membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from intracellular bacteria. Unlike bacteria in laboratory media, intracellular bacteria have a large proportion of the core stressosome protein RsbR1 associated with the membrane. However, another core protein, RsbS, is undetectable. Despite the absence of RsbS, a SigB-dependent reporter revealed that SigB activity increases gradually from early (1 h) to late (6 h) postinfection times. We also found that RsbR1 paralogues attenuate the intensity of the SigB response and that the miniprotein Prli42, reported to tether the stressosome to the membrane in response to oxidative stress, plays no role in associating RsbR1 to the membrane of intracellular bacteria. Altogether, these data indicate that, once inside host cells, the L. monocytogenes stressosome may adopt a unique configuration to sense stress and to activate SigB in the intracellular eukaryotic niche. IMPORTANCE The response to stress mediated by the alternative sigma factor SigB has been extensively characterized in Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes. These bacteria sense stress using a supramacromolecular complex, the stressosome, which triggers a cascade that releases SigB from its anti-sigma factor. Despite the fact that many structural data on the complex are available and analyses have been performed in mutants lacking components of the stressosome or the signaling cascade, the integration of the stress signal and the dynamics of stressosome proteins following environmental changes remain poorly understood. Our study provides data at the protein level on essential stressosome components and SigB activity when L. monocytogenes, normally a saprophytic bacterium, adapts to an intracellular lifestyle. Our results support activation of the stressosome complex in intracellular bacteria. The apparent loss of the stressosome core protein RsbS in intracellular L. monocytogenes also challenges current models, favoring the idea of a unique stressosome architecture responding to intracellular host cues.},

	abstract = {The Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD) system is important for survival of L. monocytogenes and other microorganisms under acidic conditions. Environmental conditions influence the function of the GAD system. Until now, the only conditions known to lead to increased transcription of the GAD system are the stationary phase in rich media and anoxic conditions. Previously, we showed that transcription of the GAD system requires unidentified compounds other than glutamate present in rich media. Following a test looking at various compounds we identified for first time that peptone, tryptone and casamino acids activate the GAD system under oxic conditions suggesting that amino acid(s) other than glutamate and/or peptides are important for the above process. The defined medium, where the GAD system is inactive, once it is supplemented with the above compounds results in an active intracellular and extracellular GAD system and increased acid resistance. Through functional genomics we show that these compounds are required for GadD2 activity and although we previously showed that GadD3 is active part of the intracellular GAD system, the supplementation did not activate this gene. The above is explained by the fact that only gadD2 transcription was upregulated by these compounds while the transcription of gadD1 and gadD3 remained unaffected. Together our results show that the L. monocytogenes GadD2 decarboxylase is activated in the presence of amino acids or peptides other than glutamate, a finding that has important implications for acid tolerance and food safety.
In this work, a comparative analysis of the peripheral cell component (PCC) proteins of Listeria monocytogenes was carried out. The study was conducted on two set of samples consisting of bacteria treated with sub-lethal concentration of nisin and untreated bacteria as control. PCC proteins were extracted by Tris-Urea-EDTA treatment and then subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. The whole cell proteome was analyzed through label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Proteomic analysis was carried out using OrbiTrap Mass Spectrometer coupled to nanoflow liquid chromatography. The treatment with sub-lethal nisin concentration resulted in 62 up regulated and 97 down regulated proteins compared to untreated samples. Using PSORTb 3.0, 19 and 18 surface proteins were detected among the up regulated and down regulated proteins, respectively. Proteins related with increased biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes, such as moonlight proteins of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and flagellin-related proteins, were identified as up regulated surface proteins. Proteins associated with virulence of L. monocytogenes, including listeriolysin O, internalin B and actin assembly-inducing protein, were detected among the down regulated proteins. To confirm proteomics data, increased production of biofilm was experimentally confirmed in nisin-treated cells through crystal violet method.
Proteosurfaceomics can be defined as the “omics” science applied to the proteins of the peripheral cell component (PCC). The surface proteins of Listeria monocytogenes, an important foodborne pathogen were investigated after treatment with nisin, a bacteriocin approved as a natural food preservative by regulatory agencies. Recent cases of nisin tolerance by Listeria spp. were documented, and deeper studies on the molecular process behind the bacterial survival may help in both understanding the development of tolerance process and comparing nisin effect with other antimicrobial compounds.
The GAD system is widely present in several types of organisms and is known to play an important role in bacterial acid tolerance. There is only one account of this system playing a role in oxidative stress in bacteria and one in yeasts. Here we show for first time that it affects the oxidative stress resistance of a Gram-positive bacterium, (L. monocytogenes, tested in three strains; 10403S, EGD-e, and LO28). We found a statistically significant reduction in survival after H2O2 exposure in ΔgadD3 and ΔgadD2 of EGD-e and in ΔgadD1 of LO28. Furthermore, we observed a lag phase prolongation in ΔgadD3 of 10403S and EGD-e and a larger inhibition zone in disk diffusion assay for ΔgadD1 and ΔgadD3 of EGD-e upon H2O2 exposure. All GAD genes playing a role in oxidative stress resistance are part of GADi system and this occurs partly through catalase activity, while the most potent GADe system plays no role. The latter effects could occur through the GABA shunt, but we show here that mutants in succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase do not show a phenotype suggesting that either effects are through the GABA transaminase or, this pathway is not involved. Our study highlights for first time the role of the GAD system in oxidative stress resistance of a Gram-positive bacterium, which could be used in Food Hurdle Technology to eliminate pathogens such as L. monocytogenes, while it gives an insight on the general mechanism.
The stress activated sigma factor sigma B (σB) plays a pivotal role in allowing the food-borne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to modulate its transcriptional landscape in order to survive in a variety of harsh environments both outside and within the host. While we have a comparatively good understanding of the systems under the control of this sigma factor much less is known about how the activity of σB is controlled. In this review, we present a current model describing how this sigma factor is thought to be controlled including an overview of what is known about stress sensing and the early signal transduction events that trigger its activation. We discuss the known regulatory overlaps between σB and other protein and RNA regulators in the cell. Finally, we describe the role of σB in surviving both saprophytic and host-associated stresses. The complexity of the regulation of this sigma factor reflects the significant role that it plays in the persistence of this important pathogen in the natural environment, the food chain as well as within the host during the early stages of an infection. Understanding its regulation will be a critical step in helping to develop rational strategies to prevent its growth and survival in the food destined for human consumption and in the prevention of listeriosis.},

	abstract = {The ability to monitor the environment for toxic chemical and physical disturbances is essential for bacteria that live in dynamic environments. The fundamental sensing mechanisms and physiological responses that allow bacteria to thrive are conserved even if the molecular components of these pathways are not. The bacterial general stress response (GSR) represents a conceptual model for how one pathway integrates a wide range of environmental signals, and how a generalized system with broad molecular responses is coordinated to promote survival likely through complementary pathways. Environmental stress signals such as heat, osmotic stress, and pH changes are received by sensor proteins that through a signaling cascade activate the sigma factor, SigB, to regulate over 200 genes. Additionally, the GSR plays an important role in stress priming that increases bacterial fitness to unrelated subsequent stressors such as oxidative compounds. While the GSR response is implicated during oxidative stress, the reason for its activation remains unknown and suggests crosstalk between environmental and oxidative stress sensors and responses to coordinate antioxidant functions. Systems levels studies of cellular responses such as transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of stressed bacteria and single-cell analysis could shed light into the regulated functions that protect, remediate, and minimize damage during dynamic environments. This perspective will focus on fundamental stress sensing mechanisms and responses in Gram-positive bacterial species to illustrate their commonalities at the molecular and physiological levels; summarize exciting directions; and highlight how system-level approaches can help us understand bacterial physiology.},

To better protect infants and children from foodborne diseases, the SAFFI (Safe Food for Infant) project promoted by the European Union in collaboration with China, will develop an integrative approach to identify, assess, detect and mitigate risks associated with microbial hazards (MHs) and chemical hazards (CHs) in infant foods. The first stage to tackle this issue was to identify relevant hazards in infant foods. By collecting data from the literature, scientific reports, existing databases, and clinical studies and using these data to compile a list of relevant foodborne hazards. These hazards caused major foodborne outbreaks, frequently contaminated foods, have large public health impacts, and/or are dangerous to young children. After the initial identification of MHs and CHs in infant foods, we will prioritize the most relevant MHs or CHs present in specific food products and rank the risks associated with these hazards based on the probability of occurrence and severity of each hazard. Standardized and systematic hazard identification (HI) and risk ranking (RR) procedures will be developed and incorporated into HI and RR computational decision support tools that will serve to help food safety agencies, food companies, and risk assessors to identify and rank MHs and CHs in the entire infant food chain in Europe and China.},

In this review, an overview on the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic pathway is given together with the role of specific chaperones dedicated for molybdenum cofactor insertion and maturation. Many bacteria are involved in geochemical cycles on earth and therefore have an environmental impact. The roles of molybdoenzymes in bioremediation and for environmental applications are presented.},

	abstract = {Plants encounter many biotic agents, such as viruses, bacteria, nematodes, weeds, and arachnids. These entities induce biotic stress in their hosts by disrupting normal metabolism, and as a result, limit plant growth and/or are the cause of plant mortality. Some biotic agents, however, interact symbiotically or synergistically with their host plants. Some microbes can be beneficial to plants and perform the same role as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, acting as a biofertilizer and/or biopesticide. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can significantly enhance plant growth and represent a mutually helpful plant-microbe interaction. Bacillus species are a major type of rhizobacteria that can form spores that can survive in the soil for long period of time under harsh environmental conditions. Plant growth is enhanced by PGPR through the induction of systemic resistance, antibiosis, and competitive omission. Thus, the application of microbes can be used to induce systemic resistance in plants against biotic agents and enhance environmental stress tolerance. Bacillus subtilis exhibits both a direct and indirect biocontrol mechanism to suppress disease caused by pathogens. The direct mechanism includes the synthesis of many secondary metabolites, hormones, cell-wall-degrading enzymes, and antioxidants that assist the plant in its defense against pathogen attack. The indirect mechanism includes the stimulation of plant growth and the induction of acquired systemic resistance. Bacillus subtilis can also solubilize soil P, enhance nitrogen fixation, and produce siderophores that promote its growth and suppresses the growth of pathogens. Bacillus subtilis enhances stress tolerance in their plant hosts by inducing the expression of stress-response genes, phytohormones, and stress-related metabolites. The present review discusses the activity of B. subtilis in the rhizosphere, its role as a root colonizer, its biocontrol potential, the associated mechanisms of biocontrol and the ability of B. subtilis to increase crop productivity under conditions of biotic and abiotic stress.},

	abstract = {Species of Bacillus are spore-forming bacteria that are resistant to aggressive physical and chemical conditions, with various species showing unusual physiological features enabling them to survive in various environmental conditions including fresh waters, marine sediments, desert sands, hot springs, Arctic soils, and the gastrointestinal tract of finfish and shellfish. They are able to rapidly replicate and tolerate a multitude of environmental conditions, giving a wide range of beneficial effects in the aquaculture sector. Application of Bacillus spp. as probiotics in feed or for bioremediation of aquaculture rearing water has great potential for sustainable aquaculture. Species of Bacillus may play a desirable role in removing waste products from aquaculture environments, maintaining optimum water quality, and reducing stress, which can lead to an improved immuno-physiological balance, better growth and enhanced survival in target aquatic animals. Application of probiotic Bacillus spp. can enhance growth and immune function of aquatic organisms. Probiotic Bacillus can also assist in maintaining a higher density of beneficial bacteria and a lower load of pathogenic agents in aquaculture ponds. Much is still unknown, however, about how the probiotic efficacy of specific Bacillus species is affected by different aquatic animal species, age and growth condition, water quality, and diet. Also, the details of mode of actions of Bacillus spp. on the immune-physiological functions of aquatic organisms as well as their functions as bioremediators of water quality need further studies. This review addresses the presence of Bacillus spp. in the gastrointestinal tract of finfish and shellfish, their ability to produce enzymes and antibacterial compounds, and their efficacy and potency as probiotics in aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Crop productivity is affected by environmental and genetic factors. Microbes that are beneficial to plants are used to enhance the crop yield and are alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Pseudomonas and Bacillus species are the predominant plant growth-promoting bacteria. The spore-forming ability of Bacillus is distinguished from that of Pseudomonas. Members of this genus also survive for a long time under unfavorable environmental conditions. Bacillus spp. secrete several metabolites that trigger plant growth and prevent pathogen infection. Limited studies have been conducted to understand the physiological changes that occur in crops in response to Bacillus spp. to provide protection against adverse environmental conditions. This review describes the current understanding of Bacillus-induced physiological changes in plants as an adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. During water scarcity, salinity and heavy metal accumulate in soil, Bacillus spp. produce exopolysaccharides and siderophores, which prevent the movement of toxic ions and adjust the ionic balance and water transport in plant tissues while controlling the pathogenic microbial population. In addition, the synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid and1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase by Bacillus regulates the intracellular phytohormone metabolism and increases plant stress tolerance. Cell-wall-degrading substances, such as chitosanase, protease, cellulase, glucanase, lipopeptides and hydrogen cyanide from Bacillus spp. damage the pathogenic bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses and pests to control their populations in plants and agricultural lands. The normal plant metabolism is affected by unfavorable environmental stimuli, which suppress crop growth and yield. Abiotic and biotic stress factors that have detrimental effects on crops are mitigated by Bacillus-induced physiological changes, including the regulation of water transport, nutrient up-take and the activation of the antioxidant and defense systems. Bacillus association stimulates plant immunity against stresses by altering stress-responsive genes, proteins, phytohormones and related metabolites. This review describes the beneficial effect of Bacillus spp. on crop plants, which improves plant productivity under unfavorable climatic conditions, and the current understanding of the mitigation mechanism of Bacillus spp. in stress-tolerant and/or stress-resistant plants.},

	abstract = {An ecological niche characterizes the position of a species within an ecosystem, comprising both the habitat requirements and the functional role of a species. Despite undergoing several substantial transformations, this century-old concept still represents a major heuristic tool for our understanding of nature. The niches of distinct, even closely related, species tend to differ in at least some aspects, as interspecific competition minimizes their overlap. In general, interspecific differences in abundance and distribution can be explained by different niche width and position. However, due to spatiotemporal population dynamics, partitioning of the niche space is never perfect, and in some part of their habitat, species will coexist in the absence of a substantial niche separation. Species’ evolution always implies the evolution of species’ niche. To some extent, we can predict niche evolution based on knowledge of the environment and of the trade-offs that affect the potential resource utilization of individual species. In the course of evolution, species have a tendency to narrow their niches due to interspecific competition and intraspecific optimization. Consequently, niche widening often occurs when a species is released from interspecific competition. Furthermore, species do not passively adapt to their niches but rather actively modify them. This feedback leads to the coevolution of species with their environments and to the evolution of whole ecological communities.},

The Bacillus cereus group includes phenotypically diversified species that are widely distributed in the environment. Often, B. cereus is considered a soil inhabitant, but it is also commonly isolated from plant roots, nematodes, and food products. Biofilms differ in their architecture and developmental processes, reflecting adaptations to specific niches. Importantly, some B. cereus strains are foodborne pathogens responsible for two types of gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea and emesis, caused by distinct toxins. Thus, the persistency of biofilms is of particular concern for the food industry, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of biofilm formation contributes to cleaning procedures. This review focuses on the genetic background underpinning the regulation of biofilm development, as well as the matrix components associated with biofilms. We also reflect on the correlation between biofilm formation and the development of highly resistant spores. Finally, advances in our understanding of the ecological importance and evolution of biofilm formation in the B. cereus group are discussed.},

	abstract = {Hexameric arginine repressor, ArgR, is the feedback regulator of bacterial L-arginine regulons, and sensor of L-arg that controls transcription of genes for its synthesis and catabolism. Although ArgR function, as well as its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is essentially the same in E. coli and B. subtilis, the two proteins differ significantly in sequence, including residues implicated in the response to L-arg. Molecular dynamics simulations are used here to evaluate the behavior of intact B. subtilis ArgR with and without L-arg, and are compared with prior MD results for a domain fragment of E. coli ArgR. Relative to its crystal structure, B. subtilis ArgR in absence of L-arg undergoes a large-scale rotational shift of its trimeric subassemblies that is very similar to that observed in the E. coli protein, but the residues driving rotation have distinct secondary and tertiary structural locations, and a key residue that drives rotation in E. coli is missing in B. subtilis. The similarity of trimer rotation despite different driving residues suggests that a rotational shift between trimers is integral to ArgR function. This conclusion is supported by phylogenetic analysis of distant ArgR homologs reported here that indicates at least three major groups characterized by distinct sequence motifs but predicted to undergo a common rotational transition. The dynamic consequences of L-arg binding for transcriptional activation of intact ArgR are evaluated here for the first time in two-microsecond simulations of B. subtilis ArgR. L-arg binding to intact B. subtilis ArgR causes a significant further shift in the angle of rotation between trimers that causes the N-terminal DNA-binding domains lose their interactions with the C-terminal domains, and is likely the first step toward adopting DNA-binding-competent conformations. The results aid interpretation of crystal structures of ArgR and ArgR-DNA complexes.},

The gene encoding σD, sigD, is part of the 31-gene fla/che operon where its location at the 3′ end, 25 kb away from the strong Pfla/che promoter, determines its expression level relative to a threshold. Here we show that addition of a single extra copy of the slrA gene in the chromosome inhibited σD-dependent gene expression. SlrA together with SinR and SlrR reduced sigD transcript by potentiating a distance-dependent decrease in fla/che operon transcript abundance that was not mediated by changes in expression from the Pfla/che promoter. Consistent with acting upstream of σD, SlrA/SinR/SlrR could be bypassed by artificial ectopic expression of sigD that hysteretically maintained for 20 generations by engaging the sigD gene at the native locus. SlrA/SinR/SlrR was also bypassed by increasing fla/che transcription and resulted a hypersensitive output in flagellin expression. Thus, flagellin gene expression demonstrated hypersensitivity and hysteresis and we conclude that σD-dependent gene expression is bistable.},

	doi = {10.1128/JB.00913-09},
	abstract = {We previously reported the identification of a gene, rbf, involved in the regulation of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. In an effort to study the mechanism of regulation, microarrays were used to compare the transcription profiles of the wild-type strain with an rbf mutant and an rbf overexpression strain of the clinical isolate UAMS-1. Among the genes affected by rbf overexpression are those of the intercellular adhesion (ica) locus; however, expression of these genes was not affected by an rbf deletion in the chromosome. The icaADBC genes are responsible for production of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), a major constituent of biofilm. The icaR gene encodes a negative regulator of icaADBC. In UAMS-1 carrying an Rbf-encoding plasmid, Rbf was found to repress icaR transcription with a concomitant increase in icaADBC expression and increased PNAG and biofilm production relative to isogenic strains lacking the plasmid. Sequencing of the rbf gene from UAMS-1 showed that there was a 2-bp insertion affecting the 50th codon of the rbf open reading frame, suggesting that rbf is a pseudogene in UAMS-1. This finding explains why deletion of rbf had no effect on biofilm formation in UAMS-1. To further characterize the Rbf regulation on biofilm we compared biofilm formation, icaA and icaR transcription, and PNAG production in 8325-4 and its isogenic rbf and icaR single mutants and an rbf icaR double mutant. Our results are consistent with a model wherein rbf represses synthesis of icaR, which in turn results in derepression of icaADBC and increased PNAG production. Furthermore, purified rbf did not bind to the icaR or icaA promoter region, suggesting that rbf controls expression of an unknown factor(s) that represses icaR. The role of rbf in controlling the S. aureus biofilm phenotype was further demonstrated in a clinical strain, MW2.},

In order to study the role of Sigma 54 in Bacillus cereus, a comparative transcriptome and phenotypic study was performed using B. cereus ATCC 14579 WT, a markerless rpoN deletion mutant, and its complemented strain. The mutant was impaired in many different cellular functions including low temperature and anaerobic growth, carbohydrate metabolism, sporulation and toxin production. Additionally, the mutant showed lack of motility and biofilm formation at air-liquid interphase, and this correlated with absence of flagella, as flagella staining showed only WT and complemented strain to be highly flagellated. Comparative transcriptome analysis of cells harvested at selected time points during growth in aerated and static conditions in BHI revealed large differences in gene expression associated with loss of phenotypes, including significant down regulation of genes in the mutant encoding enzymes involved in degradation of branched chain amino acids, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, flagella synthesis and virulence factors. Our study provides evidence for a pleiotropic role of Sigma 54 in B. cereus supporting its adaptive response and survival in a range of conditions and environments.},

	abstract = {The RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma(F) is a developmental regulatory protein that is activated in a cell-specific manner following the formation of the polar septum during the process of spore formation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Activation of sigma(F) depends on the membrane-bound phosphatase SpoIIE, which localizes to the septum, and on the formation of the polar septum itself. SpoIIE is responsible for dephosphorylating and thereby activating the phosphoprotein SpoIIAA, which, in turn, triggers the release of sigma(F) from the anti-sigma(F) factor SpoIIAB. Paradoxically, however, the presence of unphosphorylated SpoIIAA is insufficient to cause sigma(F) activation as SpoIIAA reaches substantial levels in mutants blocked in polar septation. We now describe mutants of SpoIIE, SpoIIAA, and SpoIIAB that break the dependence of sigma(F) activation on polar division. Analysis of these mutants indicates that unphosphorylated SpoIIAA must reach a threshold concentration in order to trigger the release of sigma(F) from SpoIIAB. Evidence is presented that this threshold is created by the action of SpoIIAB, which can form an alternative, long lived complex with SpoIIAA. We propose that formation of the SpoIIAA-SpoIIAB complex serves as a sink that traps SpoIIAA in an inactive state and that only when unphosphorylated SpoIIAA is in excess to the sink does activation of sigma(F) take place.},

	abstract = {Mutants of Bacillis subtilis that are temperature sensitive for RNA synthesis during sporulation were isolated after selection with a 32P suicide agent. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that two of the mutants carried an identical lesion in the rsbU gene, which encodes a phosphatase that indirectly activates SigB, the stress-responsive RNA polymerase sigma factor. The mutation appeared to cause RsbU to be hyperactive, because the mutants were more resistant than the parent strain to ethanol stress. In support of this hypothesis, pseudorevertants that regained wild-type levels of sporulation at high temperature had secondary mutations that prevented expression of the mutant rsbU gene. The properties of these RsbU mutants support the idea that activation of SigB diminishes the bacterium's ability to sporulate., IMPORTANCE Most bacterial species encode multiple RNA polymerase promoter recognition subunits (sigma factors). Each sigma factor directs RNA polymerase to different sets of genes; each gene set typically encodes proteins important for responses to specific environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, salt concentration, and nutrient availability. A selection for mutants of Bacillus subtilis that are temperature sensitive for RNA synthesis during sporulation unexpectedly yielded strains with a point mutation in rsbU, a gene that encodes a protein that normally activates sigma factor B (SigB) under conditions of salt stress. The mutation appears to cause RsbU, and therefore SigB, to be active inappropriately, thereby inhibiting, directly or indirectly, the ability of the cells to transcribe sporulation genes.},

	abstract = {Sigma factors control global switches of the genetic expression program in bacteria. Different sigma factors compete for binding to a limited pool of RNA polymerase (RNAP) core enzymes, providing a mechanism for cross-talk between genes or gene classes via the sharing of expression machinery. To analyze the contribution of sigma factor competition to global changes in gene expression, we develop a theoretical model that describes binding between sigma factors and core RNAP, transcription, non-specific binding to DNA and the modulation of the availability of the molecular components. The model is validated by comparison with in vitro competition experiments, with which excellent agreement is found. Transcription is affected via the modulation of the concentrations of the different types of holoenzymes, so saturated promoters are only weakly affected by sigma factor competition. However, in case of overlapping promoters or promoters recognized by two types of sigma factors, we find that even saturated promoters are strongly affected. Active transcription effectively lowers the affinity between the sigma factor driving it and the core RNAP, resulting in complex cross-talk effects. Sigma factor competition is not strongly affected by non-specific binding of core RNAPs, sigma factors and holoenzymes to DNA. Finally, we analyze the role of increased core RNAP availability upon the shut-down of ribosomal RNA transcription during the stringent response. We find that passive up-regulation of alternative sigma-dependent transcription is not only possible, but also displays hypersensitivity based on the sigma factor competition. Our theoretical analysis thus provides support for a significant role of passive control during that global switch of the gene expression program.},

	abstract = {A rapid and accurate method for the estimation of protein concentration is essential in various areas of biology and biochemistry. An assay originally described by Bradford (1) has become the preferred method for quantifying protein in many laboratories. This technique is simpler, faster, and more sensitive than the Lowry method. Moreover, when compared with the Lowry method, it is subject to less interference by common reagents and non-protein components of biological samples (see Note 1). Despite the introduction of alternative protein assays, the Bradford method remains a popular technique, with the original article (1) being cited over 3,500 times in primary research papers in 2006, thirty years after its initial publication.The Bradford assay relies on the binding of the dye Coomassie Blue G250 to protein. Detailed studies indicate that the free dye can exist in four different ionic forms for which the pKa values are 1.15, 1.82 and 12.4 (2). Of the three charged forms of the dye that predominate in the acidic assay reagent solution, the more cationic red and green forms have absorbance maxima at 470 nm and 650 nm, respectively. In contrast, the more anionic blue form of the dye, which binds to protein, has an absorbance maximum at 590 nm. Thus, the quantity of protein can be estimated by determining the amount of dye in the blue ionic form. This is usually achieved by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 595 nm (see Note 2).},

	abstract = {Decisions regarding microbial risk assessment usually have to be carried out with incomplete information. This is due to the large number of possible scenarios and the lack of specific data for the problem considered. Consequently, risk assessment studies are based on the information obtained with a small number of bacterial cells which are considered the most heat resistant and/or more capable of multiplying during storage. The identification of the most resistant strains is usually based on D and z-values, normally estimated from isothermal experiments. This procedure omits the potential effect that the shape of the dynamic thermal profile applied in industry has on the microbial inactivation. One example of such effects is stress acclimation, which is related to a physiological response of the cells during sub-lethal treatments that increases their resistance. In this article, we use a recently published mathematical model to compare the development of thermal resistance for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 and E. coli CECT 515 using inactivation data already published for these strains. Based only on the isothermal experiments, E. coli K12 MG1655 would be identified as more resistant to the thermal treatment than the CECT 515 strain in the 50–65°C temperature range. However, we conclude that stress acclimation is strain (and/or media)-dependent; the CECT 515 strain has a higher capacity for developing a stress acclimation than K12 MG1655 (300\% increase of the D-value for CECT 515, 50\% for K12 MG1655). It, thus, has the potential to be more resistant to the thermal treatment than the K12 MG1655 strain for some conditions allowing acclimation. A methodology is proposed to identify for which conditions this may be the case. After calibrating the model parameters representing acclimation using real experimental data, the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations, showing how the CECT 515 strain can be more resistant for some heating profiles. Consequently, the most resistant bacterial strain to a dynamic heating profile should not be identified based only on isothermal experiments (D- and z-value). The relevance of stress acclimation for the treatment studied should also be evaluated.},

The Bacillus cereus group includes phenotypically diversified species that are widely distributed in the environment. Often, B. cereus is considered a soil inhabitant, but it is also commonly isolated from plant roots, nematodes, and food products. Biofilms differ in their architecture and developmental processes, reflecting adaptations to specific niches. Importantly, some B. cereus strains are foodborne pathogens responsible for two types of gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea and emesis, caused by distinct toxins. Thus, the persistency of biofilms is of particular concern for the food industry, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of biofilm formation contributes to cleaning procedures. This review focuses on the genetic background underpinning the regulation of biofilm development, as well as the matrix components associated with biofilms. We also reflect on the correlation between biofilm formation and the development of highly resistant spores. Finally, advances in our understanding of the ecological importance and evolution of biofilm formation in the B. cereus group are discussed.},

In this review the prevalence, persistence and ecology of four major foodborne pathogens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella, Campylobacter and closely related Arcobacter, and Listeria monocytogenes, in water are discussed. These pathogens have been linked to fresh produce outbreaks, some with devastating consequences, where, in a few cases, the contamination event has been traced to water used for crop production or post-harvest activities. In addition, antimicrobial resistance, methods improvements, including the role of genomics in aiding in the understanding of these pathogens, are discussed.

	abstract = {Genetically identical individuals in bacterial populations can display significant phenotypic variability. This variability can be functional, for example by allowing a fraction of stress prepared cells to survive an otherwise lethal stress. The optimal fraction of stress prepared cells depends on environmental conditions. However, how bacterial populations modulate their level of phenotypic variability remains unclear. Here we show that the alternative sigma factor σV circuit in Bacillus subtilis generates functional phenotypic variability that can be tuned by stress level, environmental history and genetic perturbations. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics, we find the fraction of cells that immediately activate σV under lysozyme stress depends on stress level and on a transcriptional memory of previous stress. Iteration between model and experiment reveals that this tunability can be explained by the autoregulatory feedback structure of the sigV operon. As predicted by the model, genetic perturbations to the operon also modulate the response variability. The conserved sigma-anti-sigma autoregulation motif is thus a simple mechanism for bacterial populations to modulate their heterogeneity based on their environment.},

The key to such resilience is the ability of members of a population to respond and adjust to dynamic conditions in the environment. In bacteria, such responses and adjustments are mediated, at least in part, through appropriate changes in the bacterial transcriptome in response to the conditions encountered. Resilience is important for bacterial survival in diverse, complex, and rapidly changing environments and requires coordinated networks that integrate individual, mechanistic responses to environmental cues to enable overall metabolic homeostasis. In many Gram-positive bacteria, a key transcriptional regulator of the response to changing environmental conditions is the alternative sigma factor σB. σB has been characterized in a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, including the genera Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus. Recent insight from next-generation-sequencing results indicates that σB-dependent regulation of gene expression contributes to resilience, i.e., the coordination of complex networks responsive to environmental changes. This review explores contributions of σB to resilience in Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus and illustrates recently described regulatory functions of σB.},

	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is often required for the formation of bacterial biofilms and is a popular target of biofilm control strategies. Previous studies implicate the ComQXPA quorum sensing system of Bacillus subtilis as a promoter of biofilm formation. Here, we report that ComX signaling peptide deficient mutants form thicker and more robust pellicle biofilms that contain chains of cells. We confirm that ComX positively affects the transcriptional activity of the PepsA promoter, which controls the synthesis of the major matrix polysaccharide. In contrast, ComX negatively controls the PtapA promoter, which drives the production of TasA, a fibrous matrix protein. Overall, the biomass of the mutant biofilm lacking ComX accumulates more monosaccharide and protein content than the wild type. We conclude that this QS phenotype might be due to extended investment into growth rather than spore development. Consistent with this, the ComX deficient mutant shows a delayed activation of the pre-spore specific promoter, PspoIIQ, and a delayed, more synchronous commitment to sporulation. We conclude that ComX mediated early commitment to sporulation of the wild type slows down biofilm formation and modulates the coexistence of multiple biological states during the early stages of biofilm development.},

Although ArgR function, as well as its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is essentially the same in E. coli and B. subtilis, the two proteins differ significantly in sequence, including residues implicated in the response to L-arg. Molecular dynamics simulations are used here to evaluate the behavior of intact B. subtilis ArgR with and without L-arg, and are compared with prior MD results for a domain fragment of E. coli ArgR. Relative to its crystal structure, B. subtilis ArgR in absence of L-arg undergoes a large-scale rotational shift of its trimeric subassemblies that is very similar to that observed in the E. coli protein, but the residues driving rotation have distinct secondary and tertiary structural locations, and a key residue that drives rotation in E. coli is missing in B. subtilis. The similarity of trimer rotation despite different driving residues suggests that a rotational shift between trimers is integral to ArgR function. This conclusion is supported by phylogenetic analysis of distant ArgR homologs reported here that indicates at least three major groups characterized by distinct sequence motifs but predicted to undergo a common rotational transition. The dynamic consequences of L-arg binding for transcriptional activation of intact ArgR are evaluated here for the first time in two-microsecond simulations of B. subtilis ArgR. L-arg binding to intact B. subtilis ArgR causes a significant further shift in the angle of rotation between trimers that causes the N-terminal DNA-binding domains lose their interactions with the C-terminal domains, and is likely the first step toward adopting DNA-binding-competent conformations. The results aid interpretation of crystal structures of ArgR and ArgR-DNA complexes.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis is a ubiquitous soil bacterium that forms biofilms in a process that is negatively controlled by the transcription factor AbrB. To identify the AbrB-regulated genes required for biofilm formation by B. subtilis, genome-wide expression profiling studies of biofilms formed by spo0A abrB and sigH abrB mutant strains were performed. These data, in concert with previously published DNA microarray analysis of spo0A and sigH mutant strains, led to the identification of 39 operons that appear to be repressed by AbrB. Eight of these operons had previously been shown to be repressed by AbrB, and we confirmed AbrB repression for a further 6 operons by reverse transcription-PCR. The AbrB-repressed genes identified in this study are involved in processes known to be regulated by AbrB, such as extracellular degradative enzyme production and amino acid metabolism, and processes not previously known to be regulated by AbrB, such as membrane bioenergetics and cell wall functions. To determine whether any of these AbrB-regulated genes had a role in biofilm formation, we tested 23 mutants, each with a disruption in a different AbrB-regulated operon, for the ability to form biofilms. Two mutants had a greater than two-fold defect in biofilm formation. A yoaW mutant exhibited a biofilm structure with reduced depth, and a sipW mutant exhibited only surface-attached cells and did not form a mature biofilm. YoaW is a putative secreted protein, and SipW is a signal peptidase. This is the first evidence that secreted proteins have a role in biofilm formation by Bacillus subtilis.},

The phosphatase Spo0E specifically inactivates the response regulator Spo0A∼P by dephosphorylation. We identified a σB-type promoter adjacent to spo0E that is activated by the general stress response sigma factor σB and is responsible for spo0E induction in vivo. Ectopic expression of σB and subsequent induction of spo0E cause a σB-dependent block of sporulation-specific transcription of the spo0A and spoIIE genes and produces a sporulation-deficient phenotype. This effect could be erased by a deletion of the σB promoter of spo0E and thus solely addresses σB activity. Here, a molecular mechanism is shown that integrates σB activity into the decision-making process of sporulation and provides a link to interconnect these two dominant and probably mutually exclusive adaptive responses in the regulatory network of B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is able to colonize human and animal intestinal tracts and to subsequently cross the intestinal barrier, causing systemic infection. For successful establishment of infection, L. monocytogenes must survive the low pH environment of the stomach. L. monocytogenes encodes a functional ArgR, a transcriptional regulator belonging to the ArgR/AhrC arginine repressor family. We aimed at clarifying the specific functions of ArgR in arginine metabolism regulation, and more importantly, in acid tolerance of L. monocytogenes. We showed that ArgR in the presence of 10 mM arginine represses transcription and expression of the argGH and argCJBDF operons, indicating that L. monocytogenes ArgR plays the classical role of ArgR/AhrC family proteins in feedback inhibition of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Notably, transcription and expression of arcA (encoding arginine deiminase) and sigB (encoding an alternative sigma factor B) were also markedly repressed by ArgR when bacteria were exposed to pH 5.5 in the absence of arginine. However, addition of arginine enabled ArgR to derepress the transcription and expression of these two genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ArgR binds to the putative ARG boxes in the promoter regions of argC, argG, arcA, and sigB. Reporter gene analysis with gfp under control of the argG promoter demonstrated that ArgR was able to activate the argG promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of argR significantly increased bacterial survival in BHI medium adjusted to pH 3.5 with lactic acid. We conclude that this phenomenon is due to activation of arcA and sigB. Collectively, our results show that L. monocytogenes ArgR finely tunes arginine metabolism through negative transcriptional regulation of the arginine biosynthetic operons and of the catabolic arcA gene in an arginine-independent manner during lactic acid-induced acid stress. ArgR also appears to activate catabolism as well as sigB transcription by anti-repression in an arginine-dependent way.},

	abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a carbohydrate transport and phosphorylation system present in bacteria of all different phyla and in archaea. It is usually composed of three proteins or protein complexes, enzyme I, HPr, and enzyme II, which are phosphorylated at histidine or cysteine residues. However, in many bacteria, HPr can also be phosphorylated at a serine residue. The PTS not only functions as a carbohydrate transporter but also regulates numerous cellular processes either by phosphorylating its target proteins or by interacting with them in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The target proteins can be catabolic enzymes, transporters, and signal transduction proteins but are most frequently transcriptional regulators. In this review, we will describe how PTS components interact with or phosphorylate proteins to regulate directly or indirectly the activity of transcriptional repressors, activators, or antiterminators. We will briefly summarize the well-studied mechanism of carbon catabolite repression in firmicutes, where the transcriptional regulator catabolite control protein A needs to interact with seryl-phosphorylated HPr in order to be functional. We will present new results related to transcriptional activators and antiterminators containing specific PTS regulation domains, which are the phosphorylation targets for three different types of PTS components. Moreover, we will discuss how the phosphorylation level of the PTS components precisely regulates the activity of target transcriptional regulators or antiterminators, with or without PTS regulation domain, and how the availability of PTS substrates and thus the metabolic status of the cell are connected with various cellular processes, such as biofilm formation or virulence of certain pathogens.},

Its X-ray structure, as concluded from crystals of proteins from several species, is a hexamer; however, there are no studies about its conformational stability, and how its structure is modified by the pH. We have embarked on the conformational characterization of HPrK/P of Bacillus subtilis (bsHPrK/P) in solution by using several spectroscopic (namely, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD)) and biophysical techniques (namely, small-angle X-ray-scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light-scattering (DLS)). bsHPrK/P was mainly a hexamer in solution at pH 7.0, in the presence of phosphate. The protein had a high conformational stability, with an apparent thermal denaturation midpoint of {\textasciitilde}70 °C, at pH 7.0, as monitored by fluorescence and CD. The protein was very pH-sensitive, precipitated between pH 3.5 and 6.5; below pH 3.5, it had a molten-globule-like conformation; and it acquired a native-like structure in a narrow pH range (between pH 7.0 and 8.0). Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denaturation occurred through an oligomeric intermediate. On the other hand, urea denaturation occurred as a single transition, in the range of concentrations between 1.8 and 18 µM, as detected by far-UV CD and fluorescence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently the World Health Organization, Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) estimated that 31 foodborne diseases (FBDs) resulted in over 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths worldwide in 2010. Knowing the relative role importance of different foods as exposure routes for key hazards is critical to preventing illness. This study reports the findings of a structured expert elicitation providing globally comparable food source attribution estimates for 11 major FBDs in each of 14 world subregions.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Cooke's Classical Model to elicit and aggregate judgments of 73 international experts. Judgments were elicited from each expert individually and aggregated using both equal and performance weights. Performance weighted results are reported as they increased the informativeness of estimates, while retaining accuracy. We report measures of central tendency and uncertainty bounds on food source attribution estimate. For some pathogens we see relatively consistent food source attribution estimates across subregions of the world; for others there is substantial regional variation. For example, for non-typhoidal salmonellosis, pork was of minor importance compared to eggs and poultry meat in the American and African subregions, whereas in the European and Western Pacific subregions the importance of these three food sources were quite similar. Our regional results broadly agree with estimates from earlier European and North American food source attribution research. As in prior food source attribution research, we find relatively wide uncertainty bounds around our median estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first worldwide estimates of the proportion of specific foodborne diseases attributable to specific food exposure routes. While we find substantial uncertainty around central tendency estimates, we believe these estimates provide the best currently available basis on which to link FBDs and specific foods in many parts of the world, providing guidance for policy actions to control FBDs.},

However, chemical contaminants become pollutants when accumulations are sufficient to adversely affect the environment or to pose a risk to living organisms. Today, there are thousands of industrial chemicals that can be dangerous to humans and the environment. Fortunately, many of these chemicals are not produced in large enough quantities to be a human or environmental threat. However, there are many other human-made and natural chemicals that are toxic and are produced in sufficient quantities to be a potential environmental or human health hazard. Thus the production, storage, transport, and disposal of these chemicals are regulated by government agencies. There are numerous sources of chemical contaminants released to the environment, but these generally fall into a few general categories. This chapter will present an overview of the various types of chemical contaminants and their sources.},

	abstract = {This report of the EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2019 in 36 European countries (28 Member States (MS) and eight non‐MS). The first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) during 2015–2019. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU was similar to that in 2017–2018. Of the 26 MS reporting on Salmonella control programmes in poultry, 18 met the reduction targets, whereas eight failed to meet at least one. The EU prevalence of Salmonella target serovar‐positive flocks has been stable since 2015 for breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys, with fluctuations for breeding turkey flocks. Salmonella results from competent authorities for pig carcases and for poultry tested through national control programmes were more frequently positive than those from food business operators. Shiga toxin‐producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection was the third most reported zoonosis in humans and increased from 2015 to 2019. Yersiniosis was the fourth most reported zoonosis in humans in 2019 with a stable trend in 2015–2019. The EU trend of confirmed listeriosis cases remained stable in 2015–2019 after a long period of increase. Listeria rarely exceeded the EU food safety limit tested in ready‐to‐eat food. In total, 5,175 food‐borne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella remained the most detected agent but the number of outbreaks due to S. Enteritidis decreased. Norovirus in fish and fishery products was the agent/food pair causing the highest number of strong‐evidence outbreaks. The report provides further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, West Nile virus, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

It is also useful in the concentration of a variety of dissolved chemical species often following a sorption process. The present review paper focuses on the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. The process mechanisms involved are either sorptive flotation where metal bonding agents, including biosorbents, are added and the subsequent complexes are separated downstream by flotation or other conventional flotation techniques, such as ion flotation are used. In the laboratory experiments described in this paper, zinc has been used as an example, but in addition copper, nickel, arsenic, etc. are considered. A new hybrid flotation–microfiltration cell is also introduced. Copyright © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Surfactin is a biosurfactant produced by Bacillus subtilis. The srfA operon, Sfp gene, and two quorum sensing systems are required for its production. The master regulator spo0A also plays an indispensable role in proper surfactin synthesis. Upon production, surfactin itself acts as a signaling molecule and triggers the activation of Spo0A gene which in turn regulates cell differentiation. Interestingly, surfactin producing cells are immune to the action of surfactin but trigger other cells to differentiate into non-motile cells, matrix producing cells, cannibals, and spores. In case of competent cell differentiation, comS, which resides within the srfA operon, is co-expressed along with surfactin and plays a vital role in competent cell differentiation in response to quorum sensing signal. Surfactin inhibits the motility of certain cell subpopulations, although it helps the non-motile cells to swarm. Thus, surfactin plays significant roles in the differentiation of different subpopulations of specialized cell types of B. subtilis.},

In the past decades, research on lipopeptides has been fueled by their antimicrobial, antitumour, immunosuppressant and surfactant activities. However, the natural functions of lipopeptides in the lifestyles of the producing microorganisms have received considerably less attention. The substantial structural diversity of lipopeptides suggests that these metabolites have different natural roles, some of which may be unique to the biology of the producing organism. This review gives a detailed overview of the versatile functions of lipopeptides in the biology of Pseudomonas and Bacillus species, and highlights their role in competitive interactions with coexisting organisms, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, protozoa, nematodes and plants. Their functions in cell motility, leading to colonization of novel habitats, and in the formation and development of highly structured biofilms are discussed in detail. Finally, this review provides an update on lipopeptide detection and discovery as well as on novel regulatory mechanisms and genes involved in lipopeptide biosynthesis in these two bacterial genera.},

	abstract = {Many Bacillus subtilis strains swarm, often forming colonies with tendrils on agar medium. It is known that B. subtilis swarming requires flagella and a biosurfactant, surfactin. In this study, we find that water surface tension plays a role in swarming dynamics. B. subtilis colonies were found to contain water, and when a low amount of surfactin is produced, the water surface tension of the colony restricts expansion, causing bacterial density to rise. The increased density induces a quorum sensing response that leads to heightened production of surfactin, which then weakens water surface tension to allow colony expansion. When the barrier formed by water surface tension is breached at a specific location, a stream of bacteria swarms out of the colony to form a tendril. If a B. subtilis strain produces surfactin at levels that can substantially weaken the overall water surface tension of the colony, water floods the agar surface in a thin layer, within which bacteria swarm and migrate rapidly. This study sheds light on the role of water surface tension in regulating B. subtilis swarming, and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying swarming initiation and tendril formation.},

The temporary phage tolerance is executed by the stress-response RNA polymerase sigma factor σX (SigX). Artificial expression of SigX prior to phage attack largely eliminates infection. SigX tolerance is primarily conferred by activation of the dlt operon, encoding enzymes that catalyze D-alanylation of cell wall teichoic acid polymers, the major attachment sites for phages infecting Gram-positive bacteria.

However, L. monocytogenes has a high degree of strain divergence regarding virulence potential, environmental adaption, and stress response. This review seeks to provide the reader with an up-to-date overview of clonal and serotype-specific differences among L. monocytogenes strains. Emphasis on the genes and genomic islands responsible for virulence and resistance to environmental stresses is given to explain the complex adaptation among L. monocytogenes strains.

In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 33 B. thuringiensis isolates from biopesticides, food, and human fecal samples linked to outbreaks. All food and outbreak-associated isolates genomically matched (≤ 6 wgSNPs; ≤ 2 cgSNPs) with one of six biopesticide strains, suggesting biopesticide products as their source. Long-read sequencing revealed a more diverse virulence gene profile than previously assumed, including a transposase-mediated disruption of the promoter region of the non-hemolytic enterotoxin gene nhe and a bacteriophage-mediated disruption of the sphingomyelinase gene sph in some biopesticide strains. Furthermore, we provide high-quality genome assemblies of seven widely used B. thuringiensis biopesticide strains, which will facilitate improved microbial source tracking and risk assessment of B. thuringiensis-based biopesticides in the future.},

However, overproduction of surfactin in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MT45 was observed at a titre of 2.93 g/l, which is equivalent to half of the maximum biomass. To systemically unravel this efficient biosynthetic process, the genome and transcriptome of this bacterium were compared with those of B. amyloliquefaciens type strain DSM7T. MT45 possesses a smaller genome while containing more unique transporters and resistance-associated genes. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed notable enrichment of the surfactin synthesis pathway in MT45, including central carbon metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis to provide sufficient quantities of building precursors. Most importantly, the modular surfactin synthase overexpressed (9 to 49-fold) in MT45 compared to DSM7T suggested efficient surfactin assembly and resulted in the overproduction of surfactin. Furthermore, based on the expression trends observed in the transcriptome, there are multiple potential regulatory genes mediating the expression of surfactin synthase. Thus, the results of the present study provide new insights regarding the synthesis and regulation of surfactin in high-producing strain and enrich the genomic and transcriptomic resources available for B. amyloliquefaciens.},

Our results show that RapC interaction with ComA inhibits the response regulator's ability to bind its target DNA promoter but does not affect its phosphorylation state. RapC binds equally well to ComA or to ComA approximately P. The PhrC pentapeptide binds to RapC and inhibits its interaction with ComA. The D195 residue in TPR3 and the P263 residue in TPR5 of RapC are critical for the interaction with PhrC as their mutation to asparagine or leucine, respectively, prevents peptide inhibitory activity.

	abstract = {The effluent produced in refineries is in the form of an oil/water emulsion that must be treated. These emulsions are often stable and a suitable method must be used to separate the oil from the emulsion. Recently, biosurfactants or biodemulsifiers have received much attention to reduce the interfacial tension between two liquids. Biodemulsifiers are produced by microorganisms and have several benefits over chemical demulsifiers such as low-toxic, biodegradability, eco-friendly and easy synthesis. They can eliminate two phases by changing the interfacial forces between the water and oil molecules. Biosurfactants are categorized based on the molecular weight of their compounds (low or high molecular weight). Sophorolipids, lipopeptides rhamnolipids, trehalolipids, glycolipid, lipoproteins, lichenysin, surfactin, and polymeric biosurfactants are several types of biosurfactants, which are produced by bacteria or fungi. This review study provides a deep evaluation of biosurfactants in the demulsification process. To this end, different types of biosurfactants, the synthesis method of various biosurfactants using various microorganisms, features of biosurfactants, and the role of biodemulsifiers in the demulsification process are thoroughly discussed. Also, the impact of various efficient factors like pH, microorganism type, temperature, the oil content in the emulsion, and gravity on biodemulsificaion was studied. Finally, the mechanism of the demulsification process was discussed. According to previous studies, rhamnolipid biodemulsifier showed the highest biodemulsification efficiency (100\%) in the removal of oil from an emulsion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surfactants are an important category of additives that are used widely in most of the formulations as solubilizers, stabilizers, and emulsifiers. Current drug delivery systems comprise of numerous synthetic surfactants (such as Cremophor EL, polysorbate 80, Transcutol-P), which are associated with several side effects though used in many formulations. Therefore, to attenuate the problems associated with conventional surfactants, a new generation of surface-active agents is obtained from the metabolites of fungi, yeast, and bacteria, which are termed as biosurfactants.
OBJECTIVES: In this article, we critically analyze the different types of biosurfactants, their origin along with their chemical and physical properties, advantages, drawbacks, regulatory status, and detailed pharmaceutical applications.
METHODS: 243 papers were reviewed and included in this review.
RESULTS: Briefly, Biosurfactants are classified as glycolipids, rhamnolipids, sophorolipids, trehalolipids, surfactin, lipopeptides \& lipoproteins, lichenysin, fatty acids, phospholipids, and polymeric biosurfactants. These are amphiphilic biomolecules with lipophilic and hydrophilic ends and are used as drug delivery vehicles (foaming, solubilizer, detergent, and emulsifier) in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite additives, they have some biological activity as well (anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-microbial, P-gp inhibition, etc.). These biomolecules possess better safety profiles and are biocompatible, biodegradable, and specific at different temperatures.
CONCLUSION: Biosurfactants exhibit good biomedicine and additive properties that can be used in developing novel drug delivery systems. However, more research should be driven due to the lack of comprehensive toxicity testing and high production cost which limits their use.},

	abstract = {The ability of microorganisms isolated from oil reservoirs to increase oil recovery by in situ growth and metabolism following the injection of laboratory grown microbial cells and nutrients were studied. Four strains isolated from Northern German oil reservoirs at depths of 866 to 1520 m, and identified as Bacillus licheniformis, were characterized taxonomically and physiologically. All strains grew on a variety of substrates at temperatures of up to 55°C and at salinities of up to 12\% NaCl. Extracellular polymer production occurred both aerobically and anaerobically over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and salinities, though it was optimal at temperatures around 50°C and at salinities between 5 and 10\% NaCl. Strain BNP29 was able to produce significant amounts of biomass, polymer, fermentation alcohols and acids in batch culture experiments under simulated reservoir conditions. Oil recovery (core flooding) experiments with strain BNP29 and a sucrose-based nutrient were performed with lime-free and lime-containing, oil-bearing sandstone cores. Oil recovery efficiencies varied from 9.3 to 22.1\% of the water flood residual oil saturation. Biogenic acid production that accompanied oil production, along with selective plugging, are important mechanisms leading to increased oil recovery, presumably through resulting changes in rock porosity and alteration of wettability. These data show that strain BNP29 exhibits potential for the development of enhanced oil recovery processes.},

	abstract = {The depletion of oil resources, increasing global energy demand, the current low, yet unpredictable, price of oil, and increasing maturity of major oil fields has driven the need for the development of oil recovery technologies that are less costly and, where possible, environmentally compatible. Using current technologies, between 20 and 40\% of the original oil in a reservoir can be extracted by conventional production operations (e.g., vertical drilling), with secondary recovery methods yielding a further 15–25\%. Hence, up to 55\% of the original oil can remain unrecovered in a reservoir. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a tertiary recovery process that involves application of different thermal, chemical, and microbial processes to recover an additional 7–15\% of the original oil in place (OOIP) at an economically feasible production rate from poor-performing and depleted oil wells. EOR can significantly impact oil production, as increase in the recovery rate of oil by even a small margin could bring significant revenues without developing unconventional resources. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is an attractive, alternative oil recovery approach, which is claimed to potentially recover up to 50\% of residual oil. The in situ production of biological surface-active compounds (e.g., biosurfactants) during the MEOR process does not require vast energy inputs and are not affected by global crude oil prices. Compared to other EOR methods, MEOR can be an economically and more environmentally friendly alternative. In this review, the current state of knowledge of MEOR, with insights from discussions with the industry and other stakeholders, is presented and in addition to the future outlook for this technology.},

	abstract = {Microbially produced gamma poly glutamic acid (γ–PGA) is a commercially important biopolymer with many applications in foods and various other substances and are abundantly used in different parts of the world. With an aim to study the potent γ–PGA producing Bacillus species, a total of 47 different samples (Kinema, soil, and water) were randomly collected from different locations across the country, and Bacillus sp. were selectively isolated, screened, and characterized by performing physiological, biochemical, morphological, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The microbial production of γ–PGA was assayed with the selected isolates on the PGA medium and the metabolite obtained was recovered by ethanol precipitation method and further characterized by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Thermotolerance (25–60 °C), pH tolerance (4–9), and NaCl tolerance (1–9\%) tests were performed to optimize the bacterial growth and γ–PGA production and its viscosity were measured by Ostwald's viscometer. Out of 145 randomly selected colonies, 63 isolates were Gram-positive, rods, and endospore producers and were presumptively confirmed as genus Bacillus. Higher growth of γ–PGA producers were reported in 22 isolates and was found at optimum conditions such as temperature (30–37 °C), pH (6.5–7), incubation time (3 days), and NaCl concentration (3\%) and γ–PGA thus produced was further verified by TLC with the retention factor (RF) value 0.27. The potent isolates were closely similar to Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus paranthracis, and Bacillus licheniformis etc. Based on the findings of the study, B. licheniformis is the most potent γ–PGA producing Bacillus sp. which can further be used for the commercial production of γ–PGA. To the best of our knowledge, there is yet no published research from Nepal showing the production of the γ–PGA although microbially produced γ–PGA are the major constituents in some popular foods in particular communities of the country.},

	abstract = {Surfactants, both chemical and biological, are amphiphilic compounds which can reduce surface and interfacial tensions by accumulating at the interface of immiscible fluids and increase the solubility, mobility, bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation of hydrophobic or insoluble organic compounds. Investigations on their impacts on microbial activity have generally been limited in scope to the most common and best characterized surfactants. Recently a number of new biosurfactants have been described and accelerated advances in molecular and cellular biology are expected to expand our insights into the diversity of structures and applications of biosurfactants. Biosurfactants play an essential natural role in the swarming motility of microorganisms and participate in cellular physiological processes of signaling and differentiation as well as in biofilm formation. Biosurfactants also exhibit natural physiological roles in increasing bioavailability of hydrophobic molecules and can complex with heavy metals, and some also possess antimicrobial activity. Chemical- and indeed bio-surfactants may also be added exogenously to microbial systems to influence behaviour and/or activity, mimicking the latter effects of biosurfactants. They have been exploited in this way, for example as antimicrobial agents in disease control and to improve degradation of chemical contaminants. Chemical surfactants can interact with microbial proteins and can be manipulated to modify enzyme conformation in a manner that alters enzyme activity, stability and/or specificity. Both chemical- and bio-surfactants are potentially toxic to specific microbes and may be exploited as antimicrobial agents against plant, animal and human microbial pathogens. Because of the widespread use of chemical surfactants, their potential impacts on microbial communities in the environment are receiving considerable attention.},

The AL/BS mix had a surface tension of around 30 mN.m-1, indicating that the presence of alkaline lipase did not interfere in the surface activity properties of the tensoactive component. The antimicrobial activity of the AL/BS mix was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) micro-assays. Among all the tested organisms, the presence of the mixture only affected the growth of B. subtilis CCT 2576, B. cereus ATCC 10876 and L. innocua. The most sensitive microorganism was B. cereus (MIC 0.013 mg.mL-1). In addition, the effect of the sanitizer against L. innocua attached to stainless steel coupons was determined by plate count after vortexing. The results showed that the presence of the AL/BS mix improved the removal of adhered cells relative to treatment done without the sanitizer, reducing the count of viable cells by 1.72 log CFU.cm-2. However, there was no significant difference between the sanitizers tested and an SDS detergent standard (p{\textless}0.05).},

Both in its varied natural habitats and in industrial settings, B. licheniformis cells will be exposed to increases in the external osmolarity, conditions that trigger water efflux, impair turgor, cause the cessation of growth, and negatively affect the productivity of cell factories in biotechnological processes. We have taken here both systems-wide and targeted physiological approaches to unravel the core of the osmostress responses of B. licheniformis. Cells were suddenly subjected to an osmotic upshift of considerable magnitude (with 1 M NaCl), and their transcriptional profile was then recorded in a time-resolved fashion on a genome-wide scale. A bioinformatics cluster analysis was used to group the osmotically up-regulated genes into categories that are functionally associated with the synthesis and import of osmostress-relieving compounds (compatible solutes), the SigB-controlled general stress response, and genes whose functional annotation suggests that salt stress triggers secondary oxidative stress responses in B. licheniformis. The data set focusing on the transcriptional profile of B. licheniformis was enriched by proteomics aimed at identifying those proteins that were accumulated by the cells through increased biosynthesis in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, these global approaches were augmented by a set of experiments that addressed the synthesis of the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine and assessed the growth-enhancing effects of various osmoprotectants. Combined, our data provide a blueprint of the cellular adjustment processes of B. licheniformis to both sudden and sustained osmotic stress.},

	abstract = {Methylglyoxal (MG) is a toxic by-product of glycolysis that damages DNA and proteins ultimately leading to cell death. Protection from MG is often conferred by a glutathione-dependent glyoxalase pathway. However, glutathione is absent from the low-GC Gram-positive Firmicutes, such as Bacillus subtilis. The identification of bacillithiol (BSH) as the major low-molecular-weight thiol in the Firmicutes raises the possibility that BSH is involved in MG detoxification. Here, we demonstrate that MG can rapidly and specifically deplete BSH in cells, and we identify both BSH-dependent and BSH-independent MG resistance pathways. The BSH-dependent pathway utilizes glyoxalase I (GlxA, formerly YwbC) and glyoxalase II (GlxB, formerly YurT) to convert MG to d-lactate. The critical step in this pathway is the activation of the KhtSTU K(+) efflux pump by the S-lactoyl-BSH intermediate, which leads to cytoplasmic acidification. We show that cytoplasmic acidification is both necessary and sufficient for maximal protection from MG. Two additional MG detoxification pathways operate independent of BSH. The first involves three enzymes (YdeA, YraA and YfkM) which are predicted to be homologues of glyoxalase III that converts MG to d-lactate, and the second involves YhdN, previously shown to be a broad specificity aldo-keto reductase that converts MG to acetol.},

	abstract = {The stressosome is a multi-protein signal integration and transduction hub found in a wide range of bacterial species. The role that the stressosome plays in regulating the transcription of genes involved in the general stress response has been studied most extensively in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The stressosome receives and relays the signal(s) that initiate a complex phosphorylation-dependent partner switching cascade, resulting in the activation of the alternative sigma factor σB. This sigma factor controls transcription of more than 150 genes involved in the general stress response. X-ray crystal structures of individual components of the stressosome and single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions of stressosome complexes, coupled with biochemical and single cell analyses, have permitted a detailed understanding of the dynamic signalling behaviour that arises from this multi-protein complex. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses indicate that genetic modules encoding key stressosome proteins are found in a wide range of bacterial species, indicating an evolutionary advantage afforded by stressosome complexes. Interestingly, the genetic modules are associated with a variety of signalling modules encoding secondary messenger regulation systems, as well as classical two-component signal transduction systems, suggesting a diversification in function. In this chapter we review the current research into stressosome systems and discuss the functional implications of the unique structure of these signalling complexes.},

	abstract = {Bacillus licheniformis is known for its high protein secretion capacity and is being applied extensively as a host for the industrial production of enzymes such as proteases and amylases. In its natural environment as well as in fermentation processes the bacterium is often facing adverse conditions such as oxidative or osmotic stress or starvation for nutrients. During the last years detailed proteome and transcriptome analyses have been performed to study the adaptation of B. licheniformis cells to various stresses (heat, ethanol, oxidative or salt stress) and starvation conditions (glucose, nitrogen or phosphate starvation). A common feature of the response to all tested conditions is the downregulation of many genes encoding house-keeping proteins and, consequently, a reduced synthesis of the corresponding proteins. Induction of the general stress response (σ(B) regulon) is only observed in cells subjected to heat, ethanol or salt stress. This paper summarizes our current knowledge on general and specific stress and starvation responses of this important industrial bacterium. The importance of selected marker genes and proteins for the monitoring and optimization of B. licheniformis based fermentation processes is discussed.},

	abstract = {The Gram-positive endospore-forming bacterium Bacillus licheniformis can be found widely in nature and it is exploited in industrial processes for the manufacturing of antibiotics, specialty chemicals, and enzymes. Both in its varied natural habitats and in industrial settings, B. licheniformis cells will be exposed to increases in the external osmolarity, conditions that trigger water efflux, impair turgor, cause the cessation of growth, and negatively affect the productivity of cell factories in biotechnological processes. We have taken here both systems-wide and targeted physiological approaches to unravel the core of the osmostress responses of B. licheniformis. Cells were suddenly subjected to an osmotic upshift of considerable magnitude (with 1 M NaCl), and their transcriptional profile was then recorded in a time-resolved fashion on a genome-wide scale. A bioinformatics cluster analysis was used to group the osmotically up-regulated genes into categories that are functionally associated with the synthesis and import of osmostress-relieving compounds (compatible solutes), the SigB-controlled general stress response, and genes whose functional annotation suggests that salt stress triggers secondary oxidative stress responses in B. licheniformis. The data set focusing on the transcriptional profile of B. licheniformis was enriched by proteomics aimed at identifying those proteins that were accumulated by the cells through increased biosynthesis in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, these global approaches were augmented by a set of experiments that addressed the synthesis of the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine and assessed the growth-enhancing effects of various osmoprotectants. Combined, our data provide a blueprint of the cellular adjustment processes of B. licheniformis to both sudden and sustained osmotic stress.},

During heat shock, regulons known to be heat-induced in Bacillus subtilis 168 are upregulated in B. licheniformis, such as the HrcA, SigB, CtsR, and CssRS regulon. Upregulation of the SigY regulon and of genes controlled by other extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors indicates a cell-wall stress triggered by the heat shock. Furthermore, tryptophan synthesis enzymes were upregulated in heat stressed cells as well as regulons involved in usage of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources. Ethanol stress led to an induction of the SigB, HrcA, and CtsR regulons. As indicated by the upregulation of a SigM-dependent protein, ethanol also triggered a cell wall stress. To characterize the SigB regulon of B. licheniformis, we analyzed the heat stress response of a sigB mutant. It is shown that the B. licheniformis SigB regulon comprises additional genes, some of which do not exist in B. subtilis, such as BLi03885, encoding a hypothetical protein, the Na/solute symporter gene BLi02212, the arginase homolog-encoding gene BLi00198 and mcrA, encoding a protein with endonuclease activity.},

The production of the surfactin synthetase subunits and of surfactin itself was also reduced. Raising the pH to near neutrality resulted in dramatic increases in srf expression and surfactin production. This apparent pH-dependent induction of srf expression required spo0K, which encodes the oligopeptide permease that functions in cell-density-dependent control of sporulation and competence, but not CSF, the competence-inducing pheromone that regulates srf expression in a Spo0K-dependent manner. Both ComP and ComA, the two-component regulatory pair that stimulates cell-density-dependent srf transcription, were required for optimal expression of srf at low and high pHs, but ComP was not required for pH-dependent srf induction. The known negative regulators of srf, RapC and CodY, were found not to function significantly in pH-dependent srf expression. Late-growth culture supernatants at low pH were not active in inducing srf expression in cells of low-density cultures but were rendered active when their pH was raised to near neutrality. ComQ (and very likely the srf-inducing pheromone ComX) and Spo0K were found to be required for the extracellular induction of srf-lacZ at neutral pH. The results suggest that srf expression, in response to changes in culture pH, requires Spo0K and another, as yet unidentified, extracellular factor. The study also provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that ComP acts both positively and negatively in the regulation of ComA and that both activities are controlled by the ComX pheromone.},

Here we explore the ecological context for evolution of quorum sensing diversity in bacteria, where social communication is limited to members of the same quorum sensing type (pherotype). We sampled isolates of Bacillus subtilis from soil on a microgeographical scale and identified three ecologically distinct phylogenetic groups (ecotypes) and three pherotypes. Each pherotype was strongly associated with a different ecotype, suggesting that it is usually not adaptive for one ecotype to 'listen' to the signalling of another. Each ecotype, however, contained one or more minority pherotypes shared with the other B. subtilis ecotypes and with more distantly related species taxa. The pherotype diversity within ecotypes is consistent with two models: first, a pherotype cycling model, whereby minority pherotypes enter a population through horizontal genetic transfer and increase in frequency through cheating the social interaction; and second, an occasional advantage model, such that when two ecotypes are each below their quorum densities, they may benefit from listening to one another. This is the first survey of pherotype diversity in relation to ecotypes and it will be interesting to further test the hypotheses raised and supported here, and to explore other bacterial systems for the role of ecological divergence in fostering pherotype diversity.},

The global transcriptional factor CodY was hypothesized to prevent lichenysin biosynthesis under an amino acid-rich condition in Bacillus licheniformis. Thus, the codY null strain was constructed, and lichenysin production was increased by 31.0\% to 2356 mg/L with the addition of precursor amino acids, and the lichenysin production efficiency was improved by 42.8\% to 98.2 mg/L• h. Correspondingly, the transcription levels of the lichenysin synthetase gene lchAA, and its corresponding regulator genes comA, degQ, and degU, were upregulated. Also, the codY deletion enhanced biosynthesis of lichenysin precursor amino acids (Gln, Ile, Leu, and Val) and reduced the formation of byproducts, acetate, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol. This study firstly reported that lichenysin biosynthesis was negatively regulated by CodY and lichenysin production could be further improved with the precursor amino acid amendment in the codY null strain.},

We showed that activation of the SigB-controlled general stress response by mild environmental or energy stress provided significant cross-protection to subsequent lethal oxidative, disulfide and nitrosative stress in Bacillus subtilis. SigB activation is mediated via the stressosome and RsbP, the main conduits of environmental and energy stress, respectively. Cells exposed to mild environmental stress while lacking the major stressosome components RsbT or RsbRA were highly sensitive to subsequent oxidative stress, whereas rsbRB, rsbRC, rsbRD, and ytvA null mutants showed a spectrum of sensitivity, confirming their redundant roles and suggesting they could modulate the signals generated by environmental or oxidative stress. By contrast, cells encountering stationary phase stress required RsbP but not RsbT to survive subsequent oxidative stress. Interestingly, optimum cross-protection against nitrosative stress caused by sodium nitropruside required SigB but not the known regulators, RsbT and RsbP, suggesting an additional and as yet uncharacterized route of SigB activation independent of the known regulators. Together, these results provide mechanistic information on how B. subtilis promotes enhanced resistance against lethal oxidative stress during mild environmental and energy stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Bacterial biofilms are important in natural settings, biotechnology, and medicine. However, regulation of biofilm development and its persistence in different niches is complex and only partially understood. One key step during the biofilm life cycle is dispersal, when motile cells abandon the mature biofilm to spread out and colonize new niches. Here, we show that in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the general stress transcription factor SigB is essential for halting detrimental overgrowth of mature biofilm and for triggering dispersal when nutrients become limited. Specifically, SigB-deficient biofilms were larger than wild-type biofilms but exhibited accelerated cell death, significantly greater sensitivity to different stresses, and reduced dispersal. Interestingly, the signal detected by SigB to limit biofilm growth was transduced through the RsbP-dependent metabolic arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, which in turn positively controlled expression of SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation and cell motility. This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important in controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments.IMPORTANCE Biofilms are crucial for bacterial survival, adaptation, and dissemination in natural, industrial, and medical systems. Sessile cells embedded in the self-produced extracellular matrix of the biofilm benefit from a division of labor and are protected from environmental insults. However, as the biofilm ages, cells become stressed because of overcrowding, starvation, and accumulation of waste products. How does the sessile biofilm community sense and respond to stressful conditions? Here, we show that in Bacillus subtilis, the transcription factors SigB and SinR control whether cells remain in or leave a biofilm when metabolic conditions become unfavorable. This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important for controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments.},

	abstract = {Alternative sigma factors led the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) to recognize different sets of promoters to those recognized by the housekeeping sigma A-directed RNAP. This change in RNAP promoter selectivity allows a rapid and flexible reformulation of the genetic program to face environmental and metabolic stimuli that could compromise bacterial fitness. The model bacterium Bacillus subtilis constitutes a matchless living system to study the role of alternative sigma factors in gene regulation and physiology. SigB from B. sultilis was the first alternative sigma factor described in bacteria. Studies of SigB during the last 40 years have shown that it controls a genetic universe of more than 150 genes playing crucial roles in stress response, adaption and survival. Activation of SigB relies on three separate pathways that specifically respond to energy, environmental and low temperature stresses. SigB homologs, present in other Gram-positive bacteria, also play important roles in virulence against mammals. Interestingly, during recent years, others unexpected B. subtilis responses, were found to be controlled by SigB. In particular, SigB controls the efficiencies of spore and biofilm formation, two important features playing critical roles for adaptation and survival in planktonic and sessile B. subtilis communities. In B. subtilis, SigB induces the expression of the Spo0E aspartyl-phosphatase responsible for the blockage of sporulation initiation. The upregulated activity of Spo0E interconnects the two predominant adaptive pathways (i.e., sporulation and stress response) present in B. subtilis. In addition, the RsbP serine-phosphatase, belonging to the energy stress arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, controls the expression of the key transcription factor SinR to decide whether cells residing in the biofilm remain in and mantain biofilm growth or scape to colonize new niches through biofilm dispersal. Finally, SigB intervenes in the recognition and response to surrounding microorganisms, a new SigB role, that could have agronomic impact. SigB is induced when B. subtilis is confronted with phytopathogenic fungi (e.g., Fusarium verticillioides) and halts fungal growth to the benefit of plant growth. In this review, we update the knowledge on the different regulatory networks controlling the activation of SigB and its new roles described during the recent years.},

	abstract = {Different Bacillus species with PGPR (plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium) activity produce potent biofungicides and stimulate plant defense responses against phytopathogenic fungi. However, very little is known about how these PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and exhibit the antifungal response. Here, we report the antagonistic interaction between Bacillus subtilis and the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides. We demonstrate that this bacterial-fungal interaction triggers the induction of the SigB transcription factor, the master regulator of B. subtilis stress adaptation. Dual-growth experiments performed with live or dead mycelia or culture supernatants of F. verticillioides showed that SigB was activated and required for the biocontrol of fungal growth. Mutations in the different regulatory pathways of SigB activation in the isogenic background revealed that only the energy-related RsbP-dependent arm of SigB activation was responsible for specific fungal detection and triggering the antagonistic response. The activation of SigB increased the expression of the operon responsible for the production of the antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (the srfA operon). SigB-deficient B. subtilis cultures produced decreased amounts of surfactin, and B. subtilis cultures defective in surfactin production (ΔsrfA) were unable to control the growth of F. verticillioides. In vivo experiments of seed germination efficiency and early plant growth inhibition in the presence of F. verticillioides confirmed the physiological importance of SigB activity for plant bioprotection.
IMPORTANCE Biological control using beneficial bacteria (PGPRs) represents an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to pesticides for controlling plant diseases. Different PGPR Bacillus species produce potent biofungicides and stimulate plant defense responses against phytopathogenic fungi. However, very little is known about how PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and process the antifungal response. Here, we report how B. subtilis triggers the induction of the stress-responsive sigma B transcription factor and the synthesis of the lipopeptide surfactin to fight the phytopathogen. Our findings show the participation of the stress-responsive regulon of PGPR Bacillus in the detection and biocontrol of a phytopathogenic fungus of agronomic impact.},

	abstract = {Lichenysins are most potent anionic cyclic lipoheptapeptide biosurfactants produced by Bacillus licheniformis on hydrocarbonless medium with mainly glucose as carbon source. They have the capacity to lower the surface tension of water from 72 to 27 mN/m. Based on species specific variations they are named lichenysin A, B, C, D, G and surfactant BL86. The lowest ever interfacial tension against decane of 0.006 mN/m is obtained with acid precipitated lichenysin B. Surfactant BL86 and lichenysin B have recorded lowest ever CMC of 10 mg/L by any surfactant under optimal conditions. Surface and interfacial tension lowering ability bears significance in the context of oil recovery from oil reservoir. Similarity exists between structure and biosynthesis of surfactin and lichenysin. Surfactin being the most studied of the two, understanding its structure and biosynthesis gives an insight into the structure and biosynthesis of lichenysin. Lichenysin is synthesized by a multienzyme complex, lichenysin synthetase (LchA/Lic) encoded by 32.4 (26.6 kb) lichenysin operon lchA (lic). The structure of lichenysin and its operon indicate the nonribosomal biosynthesis with the same multifunctional modular arrangement as seen in surfactin synthetase SrfA. The lchA operon consists of lchAA-AC (lic A-C) and lchA TE (licTE) genes encoding the proteins LchAA, LchAB, LchAC and thioesterase LchA-TE. The licA (lchAA) gene is 10,746 bp and codes for a 3,582 amino acids protein, licB (lchAB) gene is 10,764 bp and codes for a similar sized protein, while licC (lchAC) gene is 3,864 bp and codes for protein containing 1,288 amino acid. The biotechnological potential of lichenysin in MEOR has triggered research on structure-activity relationship. Both the nature of peptide and fatty acid dictate the activity of the biosurfactant. Tailormade biosurfactant with desired attributes can be obtained from engineered synthetases. Basic studies are lacking on mechanism of biosynthesis by lichenysin synthetase however, studies on various aspects of lichenysin including regulation are expected to swell in coming years.},

The objective of this research was to check the performance of different mathematical models in predicting growth parameters, both by absorbance and plate count methods. For this purpose, growth curves of three different microorganisms (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli) grown under the same conditions, but with different initial concentrations each, were analysed. When measuring the microbial growth of each microorganism by optical density, almost all models provided quite high goodness of fit () for all growth curves. The growth rate remained approximately constant for all growth curves of each microorganism, when considering one growth model, but differences were found among models. Three-phase linear model provided the lowest variation for growth rate values for all three microorganisms. Baranyi model gave a variation marginally higher, despite a much better overall fitting. When measuring the microbial growth by plate count, similar results were obtained. These results provide insight into predictive microbiology and will help food microbiologists and researchers to choose the proper primary growth predictive model.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system. This study was conducted to estimate the U.S. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then  rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. These pathogens examined were Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, Salmonella enterica, Toxoplasma gondii, and all other FoodNet pathogens. The health burden  associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. A new method for attributing illness to foods was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation.  This method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. Based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation,  and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for Campylobacter, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, and Yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. Sensitivity analyses were conducted  to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. Disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. The top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over \$8 billion and 36,000 QALYs, or more than 50 \% of the total across all  pairs. Across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 \% of the total cost of illness and loss of QALYs.},

	abstract = {Food safety is a complex issue that has an impact on all segments of society, from the general public to government, industry, and academia. The second edition of the Bad Bug Book, published by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides current information about the major known agents that cause foodborne illness. The information provided in this handbook is abbreviated and general in nature, and is intended for practical use. It is not intended to be a comprehensive scientific or clinical reference. Under the laws administered by FDA, a food is adulterated if it contains (1) a poisonous or otherwise harmful substance that is not an inherent natural constituent of the food itself, in an amount that poses a reasonable possibility of injury to health, or (2) a substance that is an inherent natural constituent of the food itself; is not the result of environmental, agricultural, industrial, or other contamination; and is present in an amount that ordinarily renders the food injurious to health. The first includes, for example, a toxin produced by a fungus that has contaminated a food, or a pathogenic bacterium or virus, if the amount present in the food may be injurious to health. An example of the second is the tetrodotoxin that occurs naturally in some organs of some types of pufferfish and that ordinarily will make the fish injurious to health. In either case, foods adulterated with these agents are prohibited from being introduced, or offered for introduction, into interstate commerce. Our scientific understanding of pathogenic microorganisms and their toxins is continually advancing. When scientific evidence shows that a particular microorganism or its toxins can cause foodborne illness, the FDA may consider that microorganism to be capable of causing a food to be adulterated. Our knowledge may advance so rapidly that, in some cases, an organism found to be capable of adulterating food might not yet be listed in this handbook. In those situations, the FDA still can take regulatory action against the adulterated food. The agents described in this book range from live pathogenic organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, worms, and fungi, to non-living entities, such as viruses, prions, and natural toxins. Included in the chapters are descriptions of the agents' characteristics, habitats and food sources, infective doses, and general disease symptoms and complications. Also included are examples of outbreaks, if applicable; the frequency with which the agent causes illness in the U.S.; and susceptible populations. In addition, the chapters contain brief overviews of the analytical methods used to detect, isolate, and/or identify the pathogens or toxins. However, while some general survival and inactivation characteristics are included, it is beyond the scope of this book to provide data, such as D and z values, that are used to establish processes for the elimination of pathogenic bacteria and fungi in foods. One reason is that inactivation parameters for a given organism may vary somewhat, depending on a number of factors at the time of measurement. For more information on this topic, readers may wish to consult other resources. One example is the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods, the source of a comprehensive book (Microorganisms in Foods 5. Characteristics of Microbial Pathogens) on the heat resistance (D and z values) of foodborne pathogens in various food matrices, as well as data on survival and growth in many foods, including data on water activity and pH. The Bad Bug Book chapters about pathogenic bacteria are divided into two main groups, based on the structure of the microbes' cell wall: Gram negative and Gram positive. A few new chapters have been added, reflecting increased interest in certain microorganisms as foodborne pathogens or as potential sources of toxins.},

Cell extracts of the toxigenic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited sperm motility, damaged cell membrane integrity, depleted cellular ATP, and swelled the acrosome, but no mitochondrial damage was observed. The responsible agent from the B. licheniformis isolates was partially purified. It showed physicochemical properties similar to those of cereulide, despite having very different biological activity. The toxic agent was nonproteinaceous; soluble in 50 and 100\% methanol; and insensitive to heat, protease, and acid or alkali and of a molecular mass smaller than 10,000 g mol−1. The toxic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited growth of Corynebacterium renale DSM 20688T, but not all inhibitory isolates were sperm toxic. The food poisoning-related isolates were beta-hemolytic, grew anaerobically and at 55°C but not at 10°C, and were nondistinguishable from the type strain of B. licheniformis, DSM 13T, by a broad spectrum of biochemical tests. Ribotyping revealed more diversity; the toxin producers were divided among four ribotypes when cut with PvuII and among six when cut with EcoRI, but many of the ribotypes also contained nontoxigenic isolates. When ribotyped with PvuII, most toxin-producing isolates shared bands at 2.8 ± 0.2, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 11.7 ± 0.5 or 13.1 ± 0.8 kb.},

Some fungi that contaminate food can also be harmful to human health. The harmful but noninfectious health consequences of mycotoxins have been well-characterized, but the extent to which fungi in food pose a risk for invasive infections is unknown. We conducted a literature review to identify cases of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) believed to have resulted from ingestion or inhalation of food, beverages, or dietary supplements (excluding Saccharomyces infections). We identified 11 publications describing cases or small outbreaks of IFIs related to foods or beverages and three describing IFIs related to dietary supplements. These food-associated IFIs were predominantly mold infections, and the few yeast infections were associated with dairy products. Suspected foodborne IFIs appear to be rare, but are increasingly described in the electronically searchable literature. They are associated with a variety of foods, are due to a variety of fungal pathogens, and primarily occur in persons with immunosuppressive conditions or other predisposing factors. Various guidelines for high-risk patients recommend avoidance of certain food products that may contain high levels of fungi, but further work is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these restrictive diets in preventing fungal infections. The relationships between food spoilage, food insecurity, and IFI risk are another area that may warrant further exploration.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the boar sperm motility inhibition assay, six isolates from two outbreaks, out of the 94 isolates from 26 foods, were found to produce ethanol-soluble heat-stable substances that were toxic to sperm cells by depleting the mitochondrial membrane potentials. The toxic isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis and B mojavensis. Colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) were used to model the contact with the human digestive tract. The extract of B. subtilis F 2564/96 depolarized the mitochondria in intact Caco-2 cells similarly as in sperm cells. The substance responsible for these effects was purified using HPLC and identified by electron spray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry analysis as amylosin. The temperature requirement for amylosin production was 21-37 degrees C for B. subtilis and 11-21 degrees C for B. mojavensis. Both species produced amylosin in air as well as in 7-8\% CO(2) with 8-9\% O(2).
CONCLUSIONS: Food borne illness related strains of B. subtilis and B. mojavensis, produced the heat-stable toxin amylosin.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that suggests a role for the heat-stable, ion-channel forming toxin amylosin, as a virulence factor in food borne Bacillus.},

	volume = {56},
	url = {https://www.bib.irb.hr/358867},
	abstract = {In February 2000 an outbreak of food borne intoxication was registered in a small kindergarten in the town of Split (Croatia). Out of 25 exposed children, 12 exhibited symptoms of nausea, headache and vomiting 5-8 hours after eating breakfast which consisted of sandwiches made of sliced bread and rolled ham together with milk and cocoa reconstituted from milk and cocoa powder. Food analysis regarding contamination with potentially toxigenic food borne bacteria which was performed according to ISO Standards revealed no pathogenic microflora, including rotaviruses and adenoviruses. The same applies to the swabs of hands, noses, throats of the kitchen staff and from working surfaces and utensils from the kindergarten. Analysis of stool samples taken from staff as well as infected children also revealed no pathogenic microorganisms. The samples of milk and cocoa powder were examined in parallel using nonselective media. Contamination of milk powder with toxin producing B. licheniformis and B. subtilis was proved by vacuolation assay and MTT cell culture test. The examination of reconstituted milk performed in our lab showed that both species of Bacillus were able to enter the log phase of growth within 2 hours storage of the reconstituted milk at room temperature. Therefore, it was concluded that the main error in milk powder handling was to prepare the milk and cocoa beverage 2 hours prior to consumption without boiling instead of preparing it immediately before consumption taking care to boil the beverage. The application of the main HACCP principles is therefore recommended in order to avoid such incidents in small kindergartens.},

	abstract = {The emergence of pathogens is the result of a number of impact in all parts of the food chain. The emerging technologies in food production explain how new pathogens can establish themselves in the food chain and compromise food safety. The impact of the food technology is analysed for several bacteria, such as Yersinia, Campylobacter, Arcobacter, Helicobacter pullorum, Enterobacter sakazakii, Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis, prions related to vCJD and others. The importance of the ability of many microbes to form VBNC forms is elaborated on. Research on culture independent methods may address this outstanding issue to the better understanding of emerging pathogens. The "demerging" of pathogens also occur, and examples of this are explained. The reaction of bacteria to stresses and sublethal treatments, and how exposure to one stress factor can confer resistance to other stresses, literally speaking causing contagious resistance, are explained. The implication of this e.g. in modern approaches of food preservation, such as Minimally processed Foods, is considerable. Intestinal colonization of EHEC may be regulated by Quorum sensing, and this ability of microbes plays an important role in the colonization of microbes in food and on food processing equipment, an important factor in the emergence of pathogens. The emergence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an opportunistic human pathogen, used for centuries for food and production of alcoholic beverages, calls for research in molecular tools to distinguish between probiotic and clinical strains. Cyclospora cayetanensis and Norovirus outbreaks can no longer be designated as emerging pathogens, they share however one characteristic in the epidemiology of emerging nature, the importance of the hygiene in the primary production stage, including supply of potable water, and the application of GMP and the HACCP principles in the beginning of the food chain. Hepatitis E virus is a potential emerging food borne pathogen and swine may serve as a source of infection in human, a most challenging issue in greater part of the world raising pigs. Tick-borne encephalitis virus infection, either thick borne or caused by consumption of raw milk, is an increasing trend in the industrialized part of the world. Consumer awareness, ethics of food, sustainability in food production, and trust in foods, are of growing importance to the consumer. The reaction of the consumer to new technology, such as nanotechnology, is unpredictable. Many efforts should be devoted to communication of non-biased information to both the food producers as well as the consumer.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1560-7917},
	abstract = {On 5 August 2008, the National Centre of Microbiology in Madrid, Spain, notified an increase in Salmonella Kedougou isolations compared to 2007, with 21 cases including 19 children under one year of age. Active case finding and a matched case-control study were carried out to confirm this increase, identify source, transmission mode and risk factors in order to implement control measures. Cases were defined as any child under one year of age with S. Kedougou isolated since 1 January 2008, and were matched for age, sex, medical practitioner and diagnosis week with controls who were selected among patients of the cases' medical practitioners. An ad hoc questionnaire was completed for cases and controls and a univariate analysis was conducted to identify risk factors. We found 42 isolates from 11 of the 19 Spanish Regions. Completed questionnaires were available for 39 of 42 patients identified; 31 were children under one year of age and fulfilled the case definition. The median age of the 31 cases was 4.3 months and 13 were male. Main symptoms were diarrhoea (n=31) and fever (n=13). Ten cases required hospitalisation. All 31 cases had consumed infant formula milk of Brand A which was associated with illness in the univariate analysis (exact matched odds ratio: 74.92; 95\% confidence interval: 12.89-infinity). All patient isolates showed indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Five milk samples from three cases' households were negative for Salmonella. Our results suggest that Brand A was the transmission vehicle of S. Kedougou in the outbreak that occurred in Spain between January and August 2008. Food safety authorities recalled five batches of Brand A milk on 26 August 2008. No further cases have been detected as of 15 September 2009.},

Fifteen serotypes were identified in 40 Salmonella isolates; Salmonella Duesseldorf (15.0\%) and Salmonella Indiana (15.0\%) were more frequently detected than other serotypes. Resistance to chloramphenicol (82.5\%) was most common, followed by tetracycline (57.5\%), ceftiofur (52.5\%), kanamycin (52.5\%), streptomycin (50.0\%), gentamycin (45.0\%), nalidixic acid (35.0\%), ceftriaxone (32.5\%), ciprofloxacin (25.0\%), amikacin (20.0\%), and cefoxitin (15.0\%). Twenty-eight (70.0\%) isolates were resistant to ≥8 antimicrobials, with 5 (12.5\%) being resistant to 14 antimicrobials. Amino acid substitutions in gyrase A (GyrA) were most frequently detected as Ser83Arg/Asp87Glu and in p53-associated Parkin-like cytoplasmic protein (ParC), they were all Ser80Arg; the quinolone resistance gene qnrS (47.5\%) was commonly detected as well as aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [aac(6c)-Ib; 25.0\%], qnrA (17.5\%), and qnrB (15.0\%) genes. Thirty distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were identified among 40 isolates; no identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was detected among Salmonella isolates with the same serovar that was recovered in 2010 and 2012.

The cereal manufacturer reported isolating S. senftenberg in June 1994 from an undistributed cereal batch. Outbreak strains and the cereal strain were all plasmid-free in contrast to other human isolates of S. senftenberg in the same period. Changes in the production process were implemented to prevent further contamination. Surveillance centres should strengthen the detection and investigation of outbreaks of gastrointestinal infection in susceptible groups, especially young children. In this outbreak, the study of only five cases led to identification of the vehicle of infection.

METHODS: Case-control study, food trace-back and microbiologic investigations were promptly carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 141 confirmed cases {\textless}12 months of age were identified. Most had diarrhea (99\%; bloody 56\%) and fever (75\%) and 36\% were hospitalized for 5 days on average and none died. In the case-control analysis, all 23 cases and none of the 23 controls had consumed powdered formula of brand A (P {\textless} 10(-5)). Active follow up of all cases showed that after the withdrawal of formula A, cases that had consumed formula A decreased rapidly, but new cases had consumed another formula (brand B). The trace-back found that 5 batches of formula B had been manufactured on the same production line as formula A. Forty-four cases were linked to formula A and 92 to formula B. All routine controls performed by the producers were negative for Salmonella. However, enhanced microbiologic investigations yielded S. Agona in one of 176 samples of formula A, in 4 of 27 tins of formula B consumed by cases and in 6 of 420 environmental swabs from the production line. All clinical, food and environmental isolates were of the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Powdered infant formulas are not sterile products and may contain low levels of Salmonella. Routine microbiologic controls are insufficient to detect a low-grade contamination, which may cause serious illness and outbreaks among infants.},

B-Act® is a preparation containing viable spores of a Bacillus licheniformis strain. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment, which requires the identity of the strain to be established and evidence that it is not toxigenic and does not show acquired resistance to relevant antibiotics. In a previous opinion, the strain was found to meet the criteria for the QPS approach. Since no concerns are expected from other components of the additive, B-Act® is presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. In the same opinion, no conclusions could be drawn on the skin/eye irritation or skin sensitisation potential of the additive, but B-Act® was considered a potential respiratory sensitiser. Since the use of B-Act® with the target species is considered unlikely to introduce hazards for users of the product not already considered, the conclusions previously reached apply to the current application. B-Act® at the recommended dose of 1.6 × 109 colony forming units (CFU)/kg feed has the potential to be efficacious in turkeys for fattening. Since the same dose is proposed for the minor poultry species for fattening or raised for laying, the conclusions can be extended/extrapolated to these species. The conclusions on the compatibility of B-Act® with coccidiostats previously drawn apply to the current application provided that the maximum authorised concentrations of the coccidiostats for the target species are equal/lower than those for chickens.},

Three large open reading frames coding for peptide synthetases, designated licA, licB (three modules each), and licC (one module), could be detected, followed by a gene, licTE, coding for a thioesterase-like protein. The domain structure of the seven identified modules, which resembles that of the surfactin synthetases SrfA-A to -C, showed two epimerization domains attached to the third and sixth modules. The substrate specificity of the first, fifth, and seventh recombinant adenylation domains of LicA to -C (cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli) was determined to be Gln, Asp, and Ile (with minor Val and Leu substitutions), respectively.

	abstract = {Production and world consumption of spices are constantly increasing. Although the antimicrobial properties of some spices are well documented, their use in the agri-food industry is also responsible for microbial contamination and spoilage. Bacterial spores introduced by spices can withstand different preparation processes, particularly thermal treatments, leading to food alterations during storage. This review brings together data from the literature about the prevalence and concentrations of spore-forming bacteria in all commercially available spices. The sporeformers found in spices belong mainly to the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Such contaminations are very common and sometimes reach high levels, as in pepper and turmeric. Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus cereus are the most frequently detected species. Studying the harvesting, processing, and storage procedures for spices provides elements to explain why high prevalence and concentrations are observed. Spices are mostly produced in developing countries on small farms using traditional production methods. Spices become contaminated by bacterial spores in two main ways: by contact with soil during harvesting or drying, as for pepper, or by cross-contamination during the water-cooking step, as for turmeric. From these observations, we propose some recommendations.

Among the 70 honeys studied, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus laterosporus and Paenibacillus larvae subspp. larvae showed an incidence of 23\%, 4\%, 8\% and 38\%, respectively. More diversity of Bacillus species was found in rye flours than in white flours, Bacillus subtilis being the predominant species isolated from rye flour. B. cereus had an incidence of 50\% in Port Salut Argentino cheeses. Meanwhile, B. pumilus was identified in both Port Salut and Quartirolo cheeses with an incidence of 50\% and 25\%, respectively. All the spices analysed showed Bacillus mycoides as the sole aerobic spore-forming bacilli isolated. The association of the presence of B. cereus, B. subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis with both the potential spoilage of foods and foodborne outbreaks is well known. In this study, Bacillus spp. had an incidence of 38\% among all the samples analysed, therefore the monitoring of those species should be routinely done in microbiological food analyses.},

	abstract = {Contamination of dairy powders with sporeforming bacteria is a concern for dairy processors who wish to penetrate markets with stringent spore count specifications (e.g., infant powders). Despite instituted specifications, no standard methodology is used for spore testing across the dairy industry. Instead, a variety of spore enumeration methods are in use, varying primarily by heat-shock treatments, plating method, recovery medium, and incubation temperature. Importantly, testing the same product using different methodologies leads to differences in spore count outcomes, which is a major issue for those required to meet specifications. As such, we set out to identify method(s) to recommend for standardized milk powder spore testing. To this end, 10 commercial milk powders were evaluated using methods varying by (1) heat treatment (e.g., 80°C/12 min), (2) plating method (e.g., spread plating), (3) medium type (e.g., plate count milk agar), and (4) incubation time and temperature combinations (e.g., 32°C for 48 h). The resulting data set included a total of 48 methods. With this data set, we used a stepwise process to identify optimal method(s) that would explain a high proportion of variance in spore count outcomes and would be practical to implement across the dairy industry. Ultimately, spore pasteurized mesophilic spore count (80°C/12 min, incubated at 32°C for 48 h), highly heat resistant thermophilic spore count (100°C/30 min, incubated at 55°C for 48 h), and specially thermoresistant spore enumeration (106°C/30 min, incubated at 55°C for 48 h) spread plating on plate count milk agar were identified as the optimal method set for reliable enumeration of spores in milk powders. Subsequently, we assessed different powder sampling strategies as a way to reduce variation in powder spore testing outcomes using our recommended method set. Results indicated that 33-g composite sampling may reduce variation in spore testing outcomes for highly heat resistant thermophilic spore count over 11-g and 33-g discrete sampling, whereas there was no significant difference across sampling strategies for specially thermoresistant spore enumeration or spore pasteurized mesophilic spore count. Finally, an interlaboratory study using our recommended method set and a modified method set (using tryptic soy agar with 1\% starch) among both university and industry laboratories showed increased variation in spore count outcomes within milk powders, which not only was due to natural variation in powders but also was hypothesized to be due to technical errors, highlighting the need for specialized training for technicians who perform spore testing on milk powders. Overall, this study addresses challenges to milk powder spore testing and recommends a method set for standardized spore testing for implementation across the dairy industry.},

	abstract = {The thermophilic bacilli, such as Anoxybacillus flavithermus and Geobacillus spp., are an important group of contaminants in the dairy industry. Although these bacilli are generally not pathogenic, their presence in dairy products is an indicator of poor hygiene and high numbers are unacceptable to customers. In addition, their growth may result in milk product defects caused by the production of acids or enzymes, potentially leading to off-flavours. Dairy thermophiles are usually selected for by the conditions during dairy manufacture. These bacteria are able to grow in sections of dairy manufacturing plants where temperatures reach 40–65°C. Furthermore, because they are spore formers, they are difficult to eliminate. In addition, they exhibit a wide temperature growth range, exhibit a fast growth rate (generation time of approximately 15–20min) and tend to readily form biofilms. Many strategies have been tested to remove, prevent and/or delay the formation of thermophilic bacilli biofilms in dairy manufacture, but with limited success. This is, in part, because little is known about the structure and composition of thermophilic bacilli biofilms in general and, more specifically, in milk processing environments. Therefore, new cleaning regimes often do not target the problem optimally. A greater understanding of the structure of thermophilic biofilms within the context of the milk processing environment and their link with spore formation is needed to develop better control measures. This review discusses the characteristics and food spoilage potential, enumeration and identification methods for the thermophilic bacilli, as well as their importance to dairy manufacture, with an emphasis on biofilm development and spore formation.},

The efficacy of inactivation by food-processing conditions is largely determined by the characteristics of the different types of spores, whereas food composition and storage conditions determine the eventual germination and outgrowth of surviving spores. Here, we review the current knowledge on variation in spore resistance, in germination, and in the outgrowth capacity of spores relevant to foods. This includes novel findings on key parameters in spore survival and outgrowth obtained by gene-trait matching approaches using genome-sequenced Bacillus spp. food isolates, which represent notorious food spoilage and pathogenic species. Additionally, the impact of strain diversity on heat inactivation of spores and the variability therein is discussed. Knowledge and quantification of factors that influence variability can be applied to improve predictive models, ultimately supporting effective control of spore-forming bacteria in foods.},

Spores of B. weihenstephanensis were produced at 30°C and 12°C, and spores of B. licheniformis were produced at 45°C and 20°C. B. weihenstephanensis spores were then heat treated at 85°C, 90°C, and 95°C, and B. licheniformis spores were heat treated at 95°C, 100°C, and 105°C. Heat-treated spores were grown on nutrient agar at a range of temperatures (4°C to 40°C for B. weihenstephanensis and 15°C to 60°C for B. licheniformis) or a range of pHs (between pH 4.5 and pH 9.5 for both strains). The recovery temperature had a slight effect on the apparent heat resistance, except very near recovery boundaries. In contrast, a decrease in the recovery pH had a progressive impact on apparent heat resistance. A model describing the heat resistance and the ability to recover according to the sporulation temperature, temperature of treatment, and recovery temperature and pH was proposed. This model derived from secondary mathematical models for growth prediction. Previously published cardinal temperature and pH values were used as input parameters. The fitting of the model with apparent heat resistance data obtained for a wide range of spore treatment and recovery conditions was highly satisfactory.},

Thermophilic spore concentration was highly variable between powders, likely due to the different manufacturing processes used for transforming milk into dairy powders.

For some products, thermophilic spore counts were as high as 5.89 log TSC g−1.

METHOD: Retrospective review of a case.
RESULTS: A 30-year-old lady (s/p pseudophakia 10 years) presented with features of acute endophthalmitis and a vision of light perception in the left eye. She had received 15 intravitreal injections and systemic corticosteroids earlier for similar complaints. A core vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics injection improved her vision to 20/70, although the symptoms recurred a week later. Intraocular lens explantation with a repeat vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics was performed. The vitreous/aqueous fluid on both occasions grew B. licheniformis sensitive to fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, and gentamicin. One year after the second surgery, her vision was 20/30 with a quiet eye.
CONCLUSION: This case shows that delayed-onset recurrent endophthalmitis after cataract extraction may be caused by Bacillus spp. and, despite sensitivity to most antibiotics, may require intraocular lens explantation for eradication of the infection.},

	abstract = {Crop productivity is affected by environmental and genetic factors. Microbes that are beneficial to plants are used to enhance the crop yield and are alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Pseudomonas and Bacillus species are the predominant plant growth-promoting bacteria. The spore-forming ability of Bacillus is distinguished from that of Pseudomonas. Members of this genus also survive for a long time under unfavorable environmental conditions. Bacillus spp. secrete several metabolites that trigger plant growth and prevent pathogen infection. Limited studies have been conducted to understand the physiological changes that occur in crops in response to Bacillus spp. to provide protection against adverse environmental conditions. This review describes the current understanding of Bacillus-induced physiological changes in plants as an adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. During water scarcity, salinity and heavy metal accumulate in soil, Bacillus spp. produce exopolysaccharides and siderophores, which prevent the movement of toxic ions and adjust the ionic balance and water transport in plant tissues while controlling the pathogenic microbial population. In addition, the synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid and1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase by Bacillus regulates the intracellular phytohormone metabolism and increases plant stress tolerance. Cell-wall-degrading substances, such as chitosanase, protease, cellulase, glucanase, lipopeptides and hydrogen cyanide from Bacillus spp. damage the pathogenic bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses and pests to control their populations in plants and agricultural lands. The normal plant metabolism is affected by unfavorable environmental stimuli, which suppress crop growth and yield. Abiotic and biotic stress factors that have detrimental effects on crops are mitigated by Bacillus-induced physiological changes, including the regulation of water transport, nutrient up-take and the activation of the antioxidant and defense systems. Bacillus association stimulates plant immunity against stresses by altering stress-responsive genes, proteins, phytohormones and related metabolites. This review describes the beneficial effect of Bacillus spp. on crop plants, which improves plant productivity under unfavorable climatic conditions, and the current understanding of the mitigation mechanism of Bacillus spp. in stress-tolerant and/or stress-resistant plants.},

	abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

	abstract = {Mutants of Bacillis subtilis that are temperature sensitive for RNA synthesis during sporulation were isolated after selection with a 32P suicide agent. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that two of the mutants carried an identical lesion in the rsbU gene, which encodes a phosphatase that indirectly activates SigB, the stress-responsive RNA polymerase sigma factor. The mutation appeared to cause RsbU to be hyperactive, because the mutants were more resistant than the parent strain to ethanol stress. In support of this hypothesis, pseudorevertants that regained wild-type levels of sporulation at high temperature had secondary mutations that prevented expression of the mutant rsbU gene. The properties of these RsbU mutants support the idea that activation of SigB diminishes the bacterium's ability to sporulate.
IMPORTANCE Most bacterial species encode multiple RNA polymerase promoter recognition subunits (sigma factors). Each sigma factor directs RNA polymerase to different sets of genes; each gene set typically encodes proteins important for responses to specific environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, salt concentration, and nutrient availability. A selection for mutants of Bacillus subtilis that are temperature sensitive for RNA synthesis during sporulation unexpectedly yielded strains with a point mutation in rsbU, a gene that encodes a protein that normally activates sigma factor B (SigB) under conditions of salt stress. The mutation appears to cause RsbU, and therefore SigB, to be active inappropriately, thereby inhibiting, directly or indirectly, the ability of the cells to transcribe sporulation genes.},

	abstract = {Alternative sigma factors have led the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) to recognize different sets of promoters to those recognized by the housekeeping sigma A-directed RNAP. This change in RNAP promoter selectivity allows a rapid and flexible reformulation of the genetic program to face environmental and metabolic stimuli that could compromise bacterial fitness. The model bacterium Bacillus subtilis constitutes a matchless living system in the study of the role of alternative sigma factors in gene regulation and physiology. SigB from B. subtilis was the first alternative sigma factor described in bacteria. Studies of SigB during the last 40 years have shown that it controls a genetic universe of more than 150 genes playing crucial roles in stress response, adaption, and survival. Activation of SigB relies on three separate pathways that specifically respond to energy, environmental, and low temperature stresses. SigB homologs, present in other Gram-positive bacteria, also play important roles in virulence against mammals. Interestingly, during recent years, other unexpected B. subtilis responses were found to be controlled by SigB. In particular, SigB controls the efficiencies of spore and biofilm formation, two important features that play critical roles in adaptation and survival in planktonic and sessile B. subtilis communities. In B. subtilis, SigB induces the expression of the Spo0E aspartyl-phosphatase, which is responsible for the blockage of sporulation initiation. The upregulated activity of Spo0E connects the two predominant adaptive pathways (i.e., sporulation and stress response) present in B. subtilis. In addition, the RsbP serine-phosphatase, belonging to the energy stress arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, controls the expression of the key transcription factor SinR to decide whether cells residing in the biofilm remain in and maintain biofilm growth or scape to colonize new niches through biofilm dispersal. SigB also intervenes in the recognition of and response to surrounding microorganisms, a new SigB role that could have an agronomic impact. SigB is induced when B. subtilis is confronted with phytopathogenic fungi (e.g., Fusarium verticillioides) and halts fungal growth to the benefit of plant growth. In this article, we update and review literature on the different regulatory networks that control the activation of SigB and the new roles that have been described the recent years.},

	abstract = {Biomass-derived sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and other minor sugars, can be readily fermented to fuel ethanol and commodity chemicals by the appropriate microbes. Due to the differences in the optimum conditions for the activity of the fungal cellulases that are required for depolymerization of cellulose to fermentable sugars and the growth and fermentation characteristics of the current industrial microbes, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of cellulose is envisioned at conditions that are not optimal for the fungal cellulase activity, leading to a higher-than-required cost of cellulase in SSF. We have isolated bacterial strains that grew and fermented both glucose and xylose, major components of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, to l(+)-lactic acid at 50°C and pH 5.0, conditions that are also optimal for fungal cellulase activity. Xylose was metabolized by these new isolates through the pentose-phosphate pathway. As expected for the metabolism of xylose by the pentose-phosphate pathway, [13C]lactate accounted for more than 90\% of the total 13C-labeled products from [13C]xylose. Based on fatty acid profile and 16S rRNA sequence, these isolates cluster with Bacillus coagulans, although the B. coagulans type strain, ATCC 7050, failed to utilize xylose as a carbon source. These new B. coagulans isolates have the potential to reduce the cost of SSF by minimizing the amount of fungal cellulases, a significant cost component in the use of biomass as a renewable resource, for the production of fuels and chemicals.},

	abstract = {A bacterium's ability to thrive in the presence of multiple environmental stressors simultaneously determines its resilience. We showed that activation of the SigB-controlled general stress response by mild environmental or energy stress provided significant cross-protection to subsequent lethal oxidative, disulfide and nitrosative stress in Bacillus subtilis. SigB activation is mediated via the stressosome and RsbP, the main conduits of environmental and energy stress, respectively. Cells exposed to mild environmental stress while lacking the major stressosome components RsbT or RsbRA were highly sensitive to subsequent oxidative stress, whereas rsbRB, rsbRC, rsbRD, and ytvA null mutants showed a spectrum of sensitivity, confirming their redundant roles and suggesting they could modulate the signals generated by environmental or oxidative stress. By contrast, cells encountering stationary phase stress required RsbP but not RsbT to survive subsequent oxidative stress. Interestingly, optimum cross-protection against nitrosative stress caused by sodium nitropruside required SigB but not the known regulators, RsbT and RsbP, suggesting an additional and as yet uncharacterized route of SigB activation independent of the known regulators. Together, these results provide mechanistic information on how B. subtilis promotes enhanced resistance against lethal oxidative stress during mild environmental and energy stress conditions.},

Despite this expansion, relatively few new species have been isolated from infections, few are associated with food and no important new agents of foodborne illness have been reported. What has changed is our knowledge of the established agents. Bacillus cereus is well known as a cause of food poisoning, and much more is now understood about its toxins and their involvement in infections and intoxications. Also, although B. licheniformis, B. subtilis and B. pumilus have occasionally been isolated from cases of food-associated illness, their roles were usually uncertain. Much more is now known about the toxins that strains of these species may produce, so that their significances in such episodes are clearer; however, it is still unclear why such cases are so rarely reported. Another important development is the use of aerobic endosporeformers as probiotics, as the potentials of such organisms to cause illness or to be sources of antibiotic resistance need to be borne in mind.},

It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3’s functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3’s current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement—a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

The quantitative method was fully validated based on Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The LOD of the method was below 1 µg g(-1) and the repeatability ranged from 10\% to 16\%.},

	abstract = {Aims The aim of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of lichenysin production in Bacillus licheniformis and to see whether this feature was restricted to certain genotypes. Secondly, we wanted to see whether cytotoxicity reflected the measured levels of lichenysin. Methods and Results Fifty-three genotyped strains of B. licheniformis, representing a wide variety of sources, were included. lchAA gene fragments were detected in all strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All 53 strains produced lichenysins with four molecular masses as confirmed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) analysis. The amounts of lichenysin varied more than two orders of magnitude between strains and were irrespective of genotype. Finally, there was a strong association between lichenysin concentrations and toxicity towards boar spermatozoa, erythrocytes and Vero cells. Conclusions Lichenysin synthesis was universal among the 53 B. licheniformis strains examined. The quantities varied considerably between strains, but were not specifically associated with genotype. Cytotoxicity was evident at lichenysin concentrations above 10 μg ml−1, which is in accordance with previous studies. Significance and Impact of Study This study might be of interest to those working on B. licheniformis for commercial use as well as for authorities who make risk assessments of B. licheniformis when used as a food and feed additive.},

This study presents the construction of a Cre-lox-based system for multiple gene deletions in Lactobacillus plantarum that could be adapted for use on gram-positive bacteria. First, an effective mutagenesis vector (pNZ5319) was constructed that allows direct cloning of blunt-end PCR products representing homologous recombination target regions. Using this mutagenesis vector, double-crossover gene replacement mutants could be readily selected based on their antibiotic resistance phenotype. In the resulting mutants, the target gene is replaced by a lox66-P32-cat-lox71 cassette, where lox66 and lox71 are mutant variants of loxP and P32-cat is a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The lox sites serve as recognition sites for the Cre enzyme, a protein that belongs to the integrase family of site-specific recombinases. Thus, transient Cre recombinase expression in double-crossover mutants leads to recombination of the lox66-P32-cat-lox71 cassette into a double-mutant loxP site, called lox72, which displays strongly reduced recognition by Cre. The effectiveness of the Cre-lox-based strategy for multiple gene deletions was demonstrated by construction of both single and double gene deletions at the melA and bsh1 loci on the chromosome of the gram-positive model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Cre-lox-based system in multiple gene replacements was determined by successive mutagenesis of the genetically closely linked loci melA and lacS2 in L. plantarum WCFS1. The fact that 99.4\% of the clones that were analyzed had undergone correct Cre-lox resolution emphasizes the suitability of the system described here for multiple gene replacement and deletion strategies in a single genetic background.},

	abstract = {The genetic manageability of the biotechnologically important Bacillus licheniformis is hampered due to its poor transformability, whereas Bacillus subtilis efficiently takes up DNA during genetic competence, a quorum-sensing-dependent process. Since the sensor histidine kinase ComP, encoded by a gene of the quorum-sensing module comQXPA of B. licheniformis DSM13, was found to be inactive due to an insertion element within comP, the coding region was exchanged with a functional copy. Quorum sensing was restored, but the already-poor genetic competence dropped further. The inducible expression of the key regulator for the transcription of competence genes, ComK, in trans resulted in highly competent strains and facilitated the direct disruption of genes, as well as the conditional knockout of an essential operon. As ComK is inhibited at low cell densities by a proteolytic complex in which MecA binds ComK and such inhibition is antagonized by the interaction of MecA with ComS (the expression of the latter is controlled by cell density in B. subtilis), we performed an in silico analysis of MecA and the hitherto unidentified ComS, which revealed differences for competent and noncompetent strains, indicating that the reduced competence possibly is due to a nonfunctional coupling of the comQXPA-encoded quorum module and ComK. The obtained increased genetic tractability of this industrial workhorse should improve a wide array of scientific investigations.},

We analyzed 17 legacy strains dating to the early years of B. subtilis genetics. For three--NCIB 3610T, PY79, and SMY--we performed comparative genome sequencing. For the remainder, we used conventional sequencing to sample genomic regions expected to show sequence heterogeneity. Sequence comparisons showed that 168, its siblings (122, 160, and 166), and the type strains NCIB 3610 and ATCC 6051 are highly similar and are likely descendants of the original Marburg strain, although the 168 lineage shows genetic evidence of early domestication. Strains 23, W23, and W23SR are identical in sequence to each other but only 94.6\% identical to the Marburg group in the sequenced regions. Strain 23, the probable W23 parent, likely arose from a contaminant in the mutagenesis experiments that produced 168. The remaining strains are all genomic hybrids, showing one or more "W23 islands" in a 168 genomic backbone. Each traces its origin to transformations of 168 derivatives with DNA from 23 or W23. The common prototrophic lab strain PY79 possesses substantial W23 islands at its trp and sac loci, along with large deletions that have reduced its genome 4.3\%. SMY, reputed to be the parent of 168, is actually a 168-W23 hybrid that likely shares a recent ancestor with PY79. These data provide greater insight into the genomic history of these B. subtilis legacy strains.},

The immense number of living organisms precludes experimental identification of functions except in a handful of model organisms. The bacterial domain is split into large branches, among which the Firmicutes occupy a considerable space. Bacillus subtilis has been the model of Firmicutes for decades and its genome has been a reference for more than 10 years. Sequencing the genome involved more than 30 laboratories, with different expertises, in a attempt to make the most of the experimental information that could be associated with the sequence. This had the expected drawback that the sequencing expertise was quite varied among the groups involved, especially at a time when sequencing genomes was extremely hard work. The recent development of very efficient, fast and accurate sequencing techniques, in parallel with the development of high-level annotation platforms, motivated the present resequencing work. The updated sequence has been reannotated in agreement with the UniProt protein knowledge base, keeping in perspective the split between the paleome (genes necessary for sustaining and perpetuating life) and the cenome (genes required for occupation of a niche, suggesting here that B. subtilis is an epiphyte). This should permit investigators to make reliable inferences to prepare validation experiments in a variety of domains of bacterial growth and development as well as build up accurate phylogenies.},

In addition, a large proportion of the genetic capacity is devoted to the utilization of a variety of carbon sources, including many plant-derived molecules. The identification of five signal peptidase genes, as well as several genes for components of the secretion apparatus, is important given the capacity of Bacillus strains to secrete large amounts of industrially important enzymes. Many of the genes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, that are more typically associated with Streptomyces species.

	abstract = {A PCR-method for fast production of disruption cassettes is introduced, that allows the addition of long flanking homology regions of several hundred base pairs (LFH-PCR) to a marker module. Such a disruption cassette was made by linking two PCR fragments produced from genomic DNA to kanMX6, a modification of dominant resistance marker making S. cerevisiae resistant to geneticin (G418). In a first step, two several hundred base pairs long DNA fragments from the 5'- and 3'- region of a S. cerevisiae gene were amplified in such a way that 26 base pairs extensions homologous to the kanMX6 marker were added to one of their end. In a second step, one strand of each of these molecules then served as a long primer in a PCR using kanMX6 as template. When such a LFH-PCR-generated disruption cassette was used instead of a PCR-made disruption cassette flanked by short homology regions, transformation efficiencies were increased by at least a factor of thirty. This modification will therefore also help to apply PCR-mediated gene manipulations to strains with decreased transformability and/or unpredictable sequence deviations.},

	abstract = {The heat and ethanol stress response of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 was analyzed at the transcriptional and/or translational level. During heat shock, regulons known to be heat-induced in Bacillus subtilis 168 are upregulated in B. licheniformis, such as the HrcA, SigB, CtsR, and CssRS regulon. Upregulation of the SigY regulon and of genes controlled by other extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors indicates a cell-wall stress triggered by the heat shock. Furthermore, tryptophan synthesis enzymes were upregulated in heat stressed cells as well as regulons involved in usage of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources. Ethanol stress led to an induction of the SigB, HrcA, and CtsR regulons. As indicated by the upregulation of a SigM-dependent protein, ethanol also triggered a cell wall stress. To characterize the SigB regulon of B. licheniformis, we analyzed the heat stress response of a sigB mutant. It is shown that the B. licheniformis SigB regulon comprises additional genes, some of which do not exist in B. subtilis, such as BLi03885, encoding a hypothetical protein, the Na/solute symporter gene BLi02212, the arginase homolog-encoding gene BLi00198 and mcrA, encoding a protein with endonuclease activity.},

	abstract = {Glutamate is a central metabolite in all organisms since it provides the link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In Bacillus subtilis, glutamate is synthesized exclusively by the glutamate synthase, and it can be degraded by the glutamate dehydrogenase. In B. subtilis, the major glutamate dehydrogenase RocG is expressed only in the presence of arginine, and the bacteria are unable to utilize glutamate as the only carbon source. In addition to rocG, a second cryptic gene (gudB) encodes an inactive glutamate dehydrogenase. Mutations in rocG result in the rapid accumulation of gudB1 suppressor mutations that code for an active enzyme. In this work, we analyzed the physiological significance of this constellation of genes and enzymes involved in glutamate metabolism. We found that the weak expression of rocG in the absence of the inducer arginine is limiting for glutamate utilization. Moreover, we addressed the potential ability of the active glutamate dehydrogenases of B. subtilis to synthesize glutamate. Both RocG and GudB1 were unable to catalyze the anabolic reaction, most probably because of their very high Km values for ammonium. In contrast, the Escherichia coli glutamate dehydrogenase is able to produce glutamate even in the background of a B. subtilis cell. B. subtilis responds to any mutation that interferes with glutamate metabolism with the rapid accumulation of extragenic or intragenic suppressor mutations, bringing the glutamate supply into balance. Similarly, with the presence of a cryptic gene, the system can flexibly respond to changes in the external glutamate supply by the selection of mutations.},

However, sequence data alone is not sufficient to explain the biological behaviour of organisms, which arises largely from complex molecular interactions. There is a need to develop new platform technologies that can be applied to the investigation of whole-genome datasets in an efficient and cost-effective manner. One such approach is the transfer of existing knowledge from well-studied organisms to closely-related organisms. In this paper, we describe a system, BacillusRegNet, for the use of a model organism, Bacillus subtilis, to infer genome-wide regulatory networks in less well-studied close relatives.

	abstract = {The sigma(B)-dependent general stress response in the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be elicited by a range of stress factors, such as starvation or an ethanol, salt, or heat shock, via a complex upstream signaling cascade. Additionally, sigma(B) can be activated by blue light via the phototropin homologue YtvA, a component of the environmental branch of the signaling cascade. Here we use a reporter-gene fusion to show that sigma(B) can also be activated by red light via the energy branch of its upstream signaling cascade. Deletion mutagenesis and homologous overproduction experiments indicate that the RsbP protein (composed of an N-terminal Per-ARNT-Sim [PAS] domain and a C-terminal PP2C-type phosphatase domain) is involved in the red light response. This second light input pathway functions complementarily to YtvA; it shows broader spectral sensitivity but requires higher light intensities. These results are confirmed by transcriptome analyses, which show that both light effects result in upregulation of the sigma(B) regulon, with minimal activation of other responses.},

	abstract = {Bacterial biofilms are important in natural settings, biotechnology and medicine. However, regulation of biofilm development and its persistence in different niches is complex and only partially understood. One key step during the biofilm life cycle is dispersal, when motile cells abandon the mature biofilm to spread out and colonize new niches. Here, we show that in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the general stress transcription factor SigB is essential for halting detrimental overgrowth of mature biofilm and for triggering dispersal when nutrients become limited. Specifically, SigB-deficient biofilms were larger than wild-type biofilms but exhibited accelerated cell death, significantly greater sensitivity to different stresses and reduced dispersal. Interestingly, the signal detected by SigB to limit biofilm growth was transduced through the RsbP-dependent metabolic arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, which in turn positively controlled expression of SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation and cell motility. This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important in controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments.Importance Biofilms are crucial for bacterial survival, adaptation and dissemination in natural, industrial and medical systems. Sessile cells embedded in the self-produced extracellular matrix of the biofilm benefit from a division of labor and are protected from environmental insults. However, as the biofilm ages, cells become stressed because of overcrowding, starvation and accumulation of waste products. How does the sessile biofilm community sense and respond to stressful conditions? Here, we show that in Bacillus subtilis, the transcription factors SigB and SinR control whether cells remain in or leave a biofilm when metabolic conditions become unfavorable. This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important for controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments.},

	doi = {10.1038/ismej.2016.59},
	abstract = {Bacterial endospores are among the most resilient forms of life on earth and are intrinsically resistant to extreme environments and antimicrobial treatments. Their resilience is explained by unique cellular structures formed by a complex developmental process often initiated in response to nutrient deprivation. Although the macromolecular structures of spores from different bacterial species are similar, their resistance to environmental insults differs widely. It is not known which of the factors attributed to spore resistance confer very high-level heat resistance. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that in Bacillus subtilis, this is due to the presence of a mobile genetic element (Tn1546-like) carrying five predicted operons, one of which contains genes that encode homologs of SpoVAC, SpoVAD and SpoVAEb and four other genes encoding proteins with unknown functions. This operon, named spoVA2mob, confers high-level heat resistance to spores. Deletion of spoVA2mob in a B. subtilis strain carrying Tn1546 renders heat-sensitive spores while transfer of spoVA2mob into B. subtilis 168 yields highly heat-resistant spores. On the basis of the genetic conservation of different spoVA operons among spore-forming species of Bacillaceae, we propose an evolutionary scenario for the emergence of extremely heat-resistant spores in B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens. This discovery opens up avenues for improved detection and control of spore-forming bacteria able to produce highly heat-resistant spores.},

	abstract = {A variety of environmental and metabolic cues trigger the transient activation of the alternative transcription factor SigB of Bacillus subtilis, which subsequently leads to the induction of more than 150 general stress genes. This general stress regulon provides nongrowing and nonsporulated cells with a multiple, nonspecific, and preemptive stress resistance. By a proteome approach we have detected the expression of the SigB regulon during continuous growth at low temperature (15°C). Using a combination of Western blot analysis and SigB-dependent reporter gene fusions, we provide evidence for high-level and persistent induction of the sigB operon and the SigB regulon, respectively, in cells continuously exposed to low temperatures. In contrast to all SigB-activating stimuli described thus far, induction by low temperatures does not depend on the positive regulatory protein RsbV or its regulatory phosphatases RsbU and RsbP, indicating the presence of an entirely new pathway for the activation of SigB by chill stress in B. subtilis. The physiological importance of the induction of the general stress response for the adaptation of B. subtilis to low temperatures is emphasized by the observation that growth of a sigB mutant is drastically impaired at 15°C. Inclusion of the compatible solute glycine betaine in the growth medium not only improved the growth of the wild-type strain but rescued the growth defect of the sigB mutant, indicating that the induction of the general stress regulon and the accumulation of glycine betaine are independent means by which B. subtilis cells cope with chill stress.},

The DeltasigB, DeltarsbT, and DeltarsbV strains previously exhibited increased hemolytic activities compared to the hemolytic activity of the wild-type strain; therefore, transcript levels for hly were also determined. RsbT, RsbV, and sigmaB were all required for opuCA expression during growth under carbon-limiting conditions or following exposure to pH 4.5, salt, ethanol, or the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Expression of clpC was RsbT, RsbV, and sigmaB dependent in the presence of CCCP but not under the other conditions. hly expression was not RsbT, RsbV, or sigmaB dependent in the presence of either CCCP or salt. opuCA transcript levels did not increase in the presence of rapidly lethal stresses (i.e., pH 2.5 or 13 mM cumene hydroperoxide) despite the enhanced survival of the wild type compared with the survival of the mutant strains under these conditions. These findings highlight the importance of complementing phenotypic characterizations with gene expression studies to identify direct and indirect effects of null mutations in regulatory genes, such as sigB. Overall, our data show that while sigmaB activation occurs through a single pathway under both environmental and energy stress conditions, regulation of expression of some stress response and virulence genes in the sigmaB regulon (e.g., clpC) appears to require networks involving multiple transcriptional regulators.},

In the human pathogen Bacillus cereus, activation of the major stress-responsive sigma factor σ(B) is controlled by a signalling route that involves the multi-sensor hybrid histidine kinase RsbK. RsbK-type kinases are not restricted to the B. cereus group, but occur in a wide variety of other bacterial species, including members of the the low-GC Gram-positive genera Geobacillus and Paenibacillus as well as the high-GC actinobacteria. Genome context and protein sequence analyses of 118 RsbK homologues revealed extreme variability in N-terminal sensory as well as C-terminal regulatory domains and suggested that RsbK-type kinases are subject to complex fine-tuning systems, including sensitization and desensitization via methylation and demethylation within the helical domain preceding the H-box. The RsbK-mediated stress-responsive sigma factor activation mechanism that has evolved in B. cereus and the other species differs markedly from the extensively studied and highly conserved RsbRST-mediated σ(B) activation route found in Bacillus subtilis and other low-GC Gram-positive bacteria.

Genome analyses revealed that, across bacilli, rsbY and rsbK are located in a conserved gene cluster. A B. cereus rsbK deletion strain was shown to be incapable of inducing sigma(B) upon stress conditions and was impaired in its heat adaptive response. Comparison of the wild-type and rsbK mutant transcriptomes upon heat shock revealed that RsbK was primarily involved in the activation of the sigma(B)-mediated stress response. Truncation of the RsbK RR receiver domain demonstrated the importance of this domain for sigma(B) induction upon stress. The domain architecture of RsbK suggests that in the B. cereus group and in other bacilli, environmental and intracellular stress signalling routes are combined into one single protein. This strategy is markedly different from the sigma(B) activation pathway in other low-GC Gram-positives.},

While we have a comparatively good understanding of the systems under the control of this sigma factor much less is known about how the activity of σB is controlled. In this review, we present a current model describing how this sigma factor is thought to be controlled including an overview of what is known about stress sensing and the early signal transduction events that trigger its activation. We discuss the known regulatory overlaps between σB and other protein and RNA regulators in the cell. Finally, we describe the role of σB in surviving both saprophytic and host-associated stresses. The complexity of the regulation of this sigma factor reflects the significant role that it plays in the persistence of this important pathogen in the natural environment, the food chain as well as within the host during the early stages of an infection. Understanding its regulation will be a critical step in helping to develop rational strategies to prevent its growth and survival in the food destined for human consumption and in the prevention of listeriosis.},

The quality of milk is monitored via somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts, with prescribed regulatory limits to ensure quality and safety. Bacterial contaminants can cause disease, or spoilage of milk and its secondary products. Aerobic spore-forming bacteria, such as those from the genera Sporosarcina, Paenisporosarcina, Brevibacillus, Paenibacillus, Geobacillus and Bacillus, are a particular concern in this regard as they are able to survive industrial pasteurization and form biofilms within pipes and stainless steel equipment. These single or multiple-species biofilms become a reservoir of spoilage microorganisms and a cycle of contamination can be initiated. Indeed, previous studies have highlighted that these microorganisms are highly prevalent in dead ends, corners, cracks, crevices, gaskets, valves and the joints of stainless steel equipment used in the dairy manufacturing plants. Hence, adequate monitoring and control measures are essential to prevent spoilage and ensure consumer safety. Common controlling approaches include specific cleaning-in-place processes, chemical and biological biocides and other novel methods. In this review, we highlight the problems caused by these microorganisms, and discuss issues relating to their prevalence, monitoring thereof and control with respect to the dairy industry.},

The main difference is the presence of a glutaminyl residue in position 1 of the peptide sequence in place of glutamic acid in surfactin. This local variation causes significant changes in the properties of the molecule compared to surfactin. Lichenysin has a higher surfactant power, the critical micellar concentration (c.m.c.) being strongly reduced from 220 to 22 microM and a much higher hemolytic activity because 100\% hemolysis was observed with only 15 microM instead of 200 microM. Lichenysin is also a better chelating agent because its association constants with Ca2+ and Mg2+ are increased by a factor of 4 and 16, respectively. This effect is assigned to an increase in the accessibility of the carboxyl group to cations owing to a change in the side chain topology induced by the Glu/Gln exchange. Additionally, the propensity of the lipopeptide for extensive hydrophobic interactions, as illustrated by its low c.m.c., contributes to further stabilization of the cation and an increase in the partitioning of lichenysin into the erythrocyte membrane. Our data support the formation of a lichensyin-Ca2+ complex in a molar ratio of 2:1 instead of 1:1 with surfactin, suggesting an intermolecular salt bridge between two lichenysin molecules. Therefore, when Ca2+ ions are present in the solution, micellization occurs via a dimer assembly, with a possible long-range effect on the spatial arrangement of the micelles or other supramolecular structures. Finally, among all the surfactin peptidic variants so far known, lichenysin is the one for which the three tested activities are the most substantially improved.},

	abstract = {Gram-positive bacteria are ubiquitous and diverse microorganisms that can survive and sometimes even thrive in continuously changing environments. The key to such resilience is the ability of members of a population to respond and adjust to dynamic conditions in the environment. In bacteria, such responses and adjustments are mediated, at least in part, through appropriate changes in the bacterial transcriptome in response to the conditions encountered. Resilience is important for bacterial survival in diverse, complex, and rapidly changing environments and requires coordinated networks that integrate individual, mechanistic responses to environmental cues to enable overall metabolic homeostasis. In many Gram-positive bacteria, a key transcriptional regulator of the response to changing environmental conditions is the alternative sigma factor σB. σB has been characterized in a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, including the genera Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus. Recent insight from next-generation-sequencing results indicates that σB-dependent regulation of gene expression contributes to resilience, i.e., the coordination of complex networks responsive to environmental changes. This review explores contributions of σB to resilience in Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus and illustrates recently described regulatory functions of σB.},

	abstract = {This work concerns the study of the enhancement of surfactin and fengycin production by B. mojavensis A21 and application of the produced product in diesel biodegradation. The influences of the culture medium and cells immobilization were studied. The highest lipopeptides production was achieved after 72 hours of incubation in a culture medium containing 30 g/L glucose as carbon source and a combination of yeast extract (1 g/L) and glutamic acid (5 g/L) as nitrogen sources with initial pH 7.0 at 30°C and 90\% volumetric aeration. The study of primary metabolites production showed mainly the production of acetoin, with a maximum production after 24 h of strain growth. The use of immobilized cells seemed to be a promising method for improving lipopeptides productivity. In fact, the synthesis of both lipopeptides, mainly fengycin, was greatly enhanced by the immobilization of A21 cells. An increase of diesel degradation capacity of approximately 20, 27, and 40\% in the presence of 0.5, 1, and 2 g/L of produced lipopeptides, respectively, was observed. Considering these properties, B. mojavensis A21 strain producing a lipopeptide mixture, containing both surfactin and fengycin, may be considered as a potential candidate for future use in bioremediation and crop protection.},

Consequently, deletion of ilvA causes isoleucine auxotrophy. It has been reported that ilvA pseudo-revertants having a derepressed hom-thrCB operon appear in the presence of threonine. Here we have characterized two classes of ilvA pseudo-revertants. In the first class the hom-thrCB operon was derepressed unmasking the threonine dehydratase activity of the threonine synthase ThrC. In the second class of mutants, threonine biosynthesis was more broadly affected. The first class of ilvA pseudo-revertants had a mutation in the Phom promoter (P*hom), resulting in constitutive expression of the hom-thrCB operon. In the second class of ilvA pseudo-revertants, the thrR gene encoding a putative DNA-binding protein was inactivated, also resulting in constitutive expression of the hom-thrCB operon. Here we demonstrate that ThrR is indeed a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the hom-thrCB operon and the thrD aspartokinase gene. DNA binding assays uncovered the DNA-binding site of ThrR and revealed that the repressor competes with the RNA polymerase for DNA binding. This study also revealed that ThrR orthologs are ubiquitous in genomes from the Gram-positive phylum Firmicutes and in some Gram-negative bacteria.},

	abstract = {Background
Corynebacterium glutamicum is a gram-positive soil bacterium widely used for the industrial production of amino acids. There is great interest in the examination of the molecular mechanism of transcription control. One of these control mechanisms are sigma factors. C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 has seven putative sigma factor-encoding genes, including sigA and sigB. The sigA gene encodes the essential primary sigma factor of C. glutamicum and is responsible for promoter recognition of house-keeping genes. The sigB gene codes for the non-essential sigma factor SigB that has a proposed role in stress reponse.

Results
The sigB gene expression was highest at transition between exponential growth and stationary phase, when the amount of sigA mRNA was already decreasing. Genome-wide transcription profiles of the wild-type and the sigB mutant were recorded by comparative DNA microarray hybridizations. The data indicated that the mRNA levels of 111 genes are significantly changed in the sigB-proficient strain during the transition phase, whereas the expression profile of the sigB-deficient strain showed only minor changes (26 genes). The genes that are higher expressed during transition phase only in the sigB-proficient strain mainly belong to the functional categories amino acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, stress defense, membrane processes, and phosphorus metabolism. The transcription start points of six of these genes were determined and the deduced promoter sequences turned out to be indistinguishable from that of the consensus promoter recognized by SigA. Real-time reverse transcription PCR assays revealed that the expression profiles of these genes during growth were similar to that of the sigB gene itself. In the sigB mutant, however, the transcription profiles resembled that of the sigA gene encoding the house-keeping sigma factor.

Conclusion
During transition phase, the sigB gene showed an enhanced expression, while simultaneously the sigA mRNA decreased in abundance. This might cause a replacement of SigA by SigB at the RNA polymerase core enzyme and in turn results in increased expression of genes relevant for the transition and the stationary phase, either to cope with nutrient limitation or with the accompanying oxidative stress. The increased expression of genes encoding anti-oxidative or protection functions also prepares the cell for upcoming limitations and environmental stresses.},

	abstract = {Clostridium difficile is considered to be one of the most important causes of health care-associated infections worldwide. In order to understand more fully the adaptive response of the organism to stressful conditions, we examined transcriptional changes resulting from a clinically relevant heat stress (41°C versus 37°C) in C. difficile strain 630 and identified 341 differentially expressed genes encompassing multiple cellular functional categories. While the transcriptome was relatively resilient to the applied heat stress, we noted upregulation of classical heat shock genes including the groEL and dnaK operons in addition to other stress-responsive genes. Interestingly, the flagellin gene (fliC) was downregulated, yet genes encoding the cell-wall associated flagellar components were upregulated suggesting that while motility may be reduced, adherence – to mucus or epithelial cells – could be enhanced during infection. We also observed that a number of phage associated genes were downregulated, as were genes associated with the conjugative transposon Tn5397 including a group II intron, thus highlighting a potential decrease in retromobility during heat stress. These data suggest that maintenance of lysogeny and genome wide stabilisation of mobile elements could be a global response to heat stress in this pathogen.},

	abstract = {Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is an emerging nosocomial threat; incidence of infection in hospitals is increasing, both in frequency and severity, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. In order to adapt to the intestinal environment, C. difficile must react to the many stresses involved with colonization, including exposure to antibiotics, which represents the most frequent precipitating agent of C. difficile infection. The responses of C. difficile to environmental shocks (heat, pH and oxidative shock) and to growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics (amoxicillin, clindamycin and metronidazole) were investigated using the C. difficile 630 microarray developed by the Bacterial Microarray Group at St George's, University of London, UK (BmuG@S). Significantly regulated genes and operons were identified that are unique to or common between different stresses. The transcriptional profiles of C. difficile 630 are similar after growth in the presence of amoxicillin and clindamycin: both increased transcription of ribosomal protein genes and altered transcription of genes encoding surface-associated proteins. In contrast, metronidazole treatment resulted in minor changes in transcription patterns. The general stress response is observed after heat shock and acid shock. Heat shock also affected transcription of several biochemical pathways. Exposure to atmospheric oxygen induced a large number of electron transporters. This study provides a starting point for detailed analyses of numerous genes whose expression is affected by stress and may therefore be involved in adaptation to the host environment.},

	abstract = {Clostridium difficile is a major cause of diarrhoea associated with antibiotherapy. Exposed to stresses in the gut, C. difficile can survive by inducing protection, detoxification and repair systems. In several firmicutes, most of these systems are controlled by the general stress response involving σB . In this work, we studied the role of σB in the physiopathology of C. difficile. We showed that the survival of the sigB mutant during the stationary phase was reduced. Using a transcriptome analysis, we showed that σB controls the expression of ∼25\% of genes including genes involved in sporulation, metabolism, cell surface biogenesis and the management of stresses. By contrast, σB does not control toxin gene expression. In agreement with the up-regulation of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and ROS. In addition, we showed for the first time that σB also plays a crucial role in oxygen tolerance in this strict anaerobe. Finally, we demonstrated that the fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain.},

	abstract = {General stress proteins protect Bacillus subtilis cells against a variety of environmental insults. This adaptive response is particularly important for nongrowing cells, to which it confers a multiple, nonspecific, and preemptive stress resistance. Induction of the general stress response relies on the alternative transcription factor, SigB, whose activity is controlled by a partner switching mechanism that also involves the anti-sigma factor, RsbW, and the antagonist protein, RsbV. Recently, the SigB regulon has been shown to be continuously induced and functionally important in cells actively growing at low temperature. With the exception of this chill induction, all SigB-activating stimuli identified so far trigger a transient expression of the SigB regulon that depends on RsbV. Through a proteome analysis and Northern blot and gene fusion experiments, we now show that the SigB regulon is continuously induced in cells growing actively at 51°C, close to the upper growth limit of B. subtilis. This heat induction of SigB-dependent genes requires the environmental stress-responsive phosphatase RsbU, but not the metabolic stress-responsive phosphatase RsbP. RsbU dependence of SigB activation by heat is overcome in mutants that lack RsbV. In addition, loss of RsbV alone or in combination with RsbU triggers a hyperactivation of the general stress regulon exclusively at high temperatures detrimental for cell growth. These new facets of heat induction of the SigB regulon indicate that the current view of the complex genetic and biochemical regulation of SigB activity is still incomplete and that SigB perceives signals independent of the RsbV-mediated signal transduction pathways under heat stress conditions.},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the PHYML program, which is freely available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/.},

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

Although almost 50\% of the proteins encoded by the newly discovered sigma(B)-dependent stress genes seem to be membrane localized, biochemical functions have so far not been defined for any of the gene products. Allocation of the genes to the sigma(B)-dependent stress regulon may indicate a potential function in the establishment of a multiple stress resistance.

Most of them belong to the stress and stationary-phase regulon controlled by the alternative sigma factor sigmaB. The majority of sigmaB-dependent proteins are thought to provide a precautionary general stress resistance in stressed or starved cells. In this report, the identification and transcriptional analysis of nine new members of the sigmaB regulon are described. The biochemical function was not determined for any of the proteins encoded by the nine new sigmaB-dependent stress genes, however, similarities to proteins in the databases allowed a distinction between proteins with putative (i-iv) and unknown (v) function. The putative functions of BmrU, YcdF, YdaD, YdaP, YhdN and YocK underline the suggested protective role of sigmaB-dependent GSPs and also elucidate new areas where sigmaB might play an important role. (i) The finding that the bmrUR operon is under sigmaB control indicates that the elimination of multidrug compounds might be a new function in multiple stress resistance. (ii) YcdF and YdaD resemble NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases. Both proteins could be involved in the generation of NAD(P)H and therefore in the maintenance of the intracellular redox balance under stress. (iii) The ydaP gene might belong to the increasing number of sigmaB-dependent genes whose orthologues are under the control of sigmas in Escherichia coli, indicating that both regulons may fulfil similar functions. (iv) YhdN shows weak similarities to potassium ion channel proteins and YocK shows resemblance to the DnaK suppressor protein DksA. (v) Three new sigmaB-dependent genes (ydaE, ydaG and yfkM) encoding proteins with still unknown functions were also described.

	abstract = {The structure of the SigB-dependent general stress regulon of Bacillus subtilis has previously been characterized by proteomics approaches as well as DNA array-based expression studies. However, comparing the SigB targets published in three previous major transcriptional profiling studies it is obvious that although each of them identified well above 100 target genes, only 67 were identified in all three studies. These substantial differences can likely be attributed to the different strains, growth conditions, microarray platforms and experimental setups used in the studies. In order to gain a better understanding of the structure of this important regulon, a targeted DNA microarray analysis covering most of the known SigB-inducing conditions was performed, and the changes in expression kinetics of 252 potential members of the SigB regulon and appropriate control genes were recorded. Transcriptional data for the B. subtilis wild-type strain 168 and its isogenic sigB mutant BSM29 were analysed using random forest, a machine learning algorithm, by incorporating the knowledge from previous studies. This analysis revealed a strictly SigB-dependent expression pattern for 166 genes following ethanol, butanol, osmotic and oxidative stress, low-temperature growth and heat shock, as well as limitation of oxygen or glucose. Kinetic analysis of the data for the wild-type strain identified 30 additional members of the SigB regulon, which were also subject to control by additional transcriptional regulators, thus displaying atypical SigB-independent induction patterns in the mutant strain under some of the conditions tested. For 19 of these 30 SigB regulon members, published reports support control by secondary regulators along with SigB. Thus, this microarray-based study assigns a total of 196 genes to the SigB-dependent general stress regulon of B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {Gene arrays containing all currently known open reading frames of Bacillus subtilis were used to examine the general stress response of Bacillus. By proteomics, transcriptional analysis, transposon mutagenesis, and consensus promoter-based screening, 75 genes had previously been described as sigma(B)-dependent general stress genes. The present gene array-based analysis confirmed 62 of these already known general stress genes and detected 63 additional genes subject to control by the stress sigma factor sigma(B). At least 24 of these 125 sigma(B)-dependent genes seemed to be subject to a second, sigma(B)-independent stress induction mechanism. Therefore, this transcriptional profiling revealed almost four times as many regulon members as the proteomic approach, but failure of confirmation of all known members of the sigma(B) regulon indicates that even this approach has not yet elucidated the entire regulon. Most of the sigma(B)-dependent general stress proteins are probably located in the cytoplasm, but 25 contain at least one membrane-spanning domain, and at least 6 proteins appear to be secreted. The functions of most of the newly described genes are still unknown. However, their classification as sigma(B)-dependent stress genes argues that their products most likely perform functions in stress management and help to provide the nongrowing cell with multiple stress resistance. A comprehensive screening program analyzing the multiple stress resistance of mutants with mutations in single stress genes is in progress. The first results of this program, showing the diminished salt resistance of yjbC and yjbD mutants compared to that of the wild type, are presented. Only a few new sigma(B)-dependent proteins with already known functions were found, among them SodA, encoding a superoxide dismutase. In addition to analysis of the sigma(B)-dependent general stress regulon, a comprehensive list of genes induced by heat, salt, or ethanol stress in a sigma(B)-independent manner is presented. Perhaps the most interesting of the sigma(B)-independent stress phenomena was the induction of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor sigma(W) and its entire regulon by salt shock.},

Since the previous release, the original content was extended by the addition of the data contained in 569 new publications, the total of which now reaches 947. The number of B. subtilis promoters annotated in the database was more than doubled to 1475. In addition, 463 experimentally validated B. subtilis operons and their terminators have been included. Given the increase in the number of fully sequenced bacterial genomes, we decided to extend the usability of DBTBS in comparative regulatory genomics. We therefore created a new section on the conservation of the upstream regulatory sequences between homologous genes in 40 Gram-positive bacterial species, as well as on the presence of overrepresented hexameric motifs that may have regulatory functions.

In the literature, there is a lack of information on Gram-positive bacterial promoter sequences compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Promoter sequence identification is essential for studying gene expression. Initially, we collected the B. subtilis genome sequence from the NCBI database, and promoters were identified by their sigma factors in the DBTBS database. We then grouped the promoters according to 15 factors in 2 domains, corresponding to sigma 54 and sigma 70 of Gram-negative bacteria. Based on these data we developed a script in Python to search for promoters in the B. subtilis genome. After processing the data, we obtained 767 promoter sequences for B. subtilis, most of which were recognized by sigma SigA. To validate the data we found, we developed a software package called BacSVM+, which receives promoters as input and returns the best combination of parameters in a LibSVM library to predict promoter regions in the bacteria used in the simulation. All data gathered as well as the BacSVM+ software is available for download at http://bacpp.bioinfoucs.com/rafael/Sigmas.zip.},

	abstract = {Background
The Bacillus cereus sensu lato group currently includes seven species (B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis and B. cytotoxicus) that recent phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses suggest are likely a single species, despite their varied phenotypes. Although horizontal gene transfer and insertion-deletion events are clearly important for promoting divergence among these genomes, recent studies have demonstrated that a major basis for phenotypic diversity in these organisms may be differential regulation of the highly similar gene content shared by these organisms. To explore this hypothesis, we used an in silico approach to evaluate the relationship of pathogenic potential and the divergence of the SigB-dependent general stress response within the B. cereus sensu lato group, since SigB has been demonstrated to support pathogenesis in Bacillus, Listeria and Staphylococcus species.

Results
During the divergence of these organisms from a common “SigB-less” ancestor, the placement of SigB promoters at varied locations in the B. cereus sensu lato genomes predict alternative structures for the SigB regulon in different organisms. Predicted promoter changes suggesting differential transcriptional control of a common gene pool predominate over evidence of indels or horizontal gene transfer for explaining SigB regulon divergence.

Conclusions
Four lineages of the SigB regulon have arisen that encompass different gene contents and suggest different strategies for supporting pathogenesis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that divergence within the B. cereus sensu lato group rests in part on alternative strategies for regulation of a common gene pool.},

The TUs that displayed correlated expression were used to identify putative cis‐regulatory elements by searching the upstream regions of the TUs for conserved motifs. Predicted motifs were extended and refined by searching for motifs in the upstream regions of additional TUs with correlated expression. In this way, cis‐acting elements were identified for 41 regulons consisting of at least four TUs (correlation {\textgreater} 0.7). This set of regulons included the known regulons of CtsR and LexA, but also several novel ones encompassing genes with coherent biological functions. Visualization of the regulons and their connections revealed a highly interconnected regulatory network.

TUs were predicted for two species sets, with different evolutionary distances to L.plantarum. TUs were designated ‘cluster of orthologous transcriptional units’ (COT) when {\textgreater}50\% of the genes were orthologous in different species. Conserved DNA sequences were detected in the upstream regions of different COTs. Subsequently, conserved motifs were used to scan upstream regions of all TUs. This method revealed 18 regulatory motifs only present in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The 18 LAB-specific candidate regulatory motifs included 13 that were not described previously. These LAB-specific different motifs were found in front of genes encoding functions varying from cold shock proteins to RNA and DNA polymerases, and many unknown functions. The best-described LAB-specific motif found was the CopR-binding site, regulating expression of copper transport ATPases. Finally, all detected motifs were used to predict co-regulated TUs (regulons) for L.plantarum, and transcriptome profiling data were analyzed to provide regulon prediction validation. It is demonstrated that phylogenetic footprinting using different species sets can identify and distinguish between general regulatory motifs and LAB-specific regulatory motifs.},

We recently described FastTree, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “CAT” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

Conclusions/Significance
FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

It is now feasible to make efficient profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) searches via the web. A HMMER web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

	abstract = {Background
In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.

Results
We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.

Conclusions
MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely available at .},

	abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis clpP gene, encoding the proteolytic component of the Clp or Ti protease, was cloned and sequenced. The amount of clpP-specific mRNA increased after heat shock, salt and ethanol stress, as well as after treatment with puromycin. Two transcriptional start sites upstream of the clpP structural gene were identified, preceded by sequences resembling the consensus sequences of promoters recognized by sigmaA and sigmaB transcriptional factors of the B. subtilis RNA polymerase respectively. Transcription initiation occurred predominantly at the putative sigmaA-dependent promoter in exponentially growing cells and was induced under stress conditions. After exposure to stress, initiation of transcription also increased at the sigmaB-dependent promoter, but to a lesser extent, indicating that clpP belongs to a double promoter-controlled subgroup of class III general stress genes in B. subtilis. In a sigB mutant strain, clpP remained heat and stress inducible at the sigmaA-dependent promoter. BgaB-reporter gene fusions, carrying either the sigmaA- or the sigmaB-dependent promoter, showed a higher bgaB induction at the sigmaA-dependent promoter, whereas a significantly lower level of induction was measured at the sigmaB-dependent promoter. The sigmaA-dependent promoter appeared to be crucial for the heat-inducible transcription of clpP. A CIRCE (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) element, the characteristic regulation target of class I heat shock genes such as dnaK and groESL, was not found between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Mutants lacking either the proteolytic component ClpP or the regulatory ATPase component ClpX were phenotypically distinct from the wild type. Both mutants produced chains of elongated cells and exhibited severely impaired growth under stress conditions and starvation. Comparison of two-dimensional protein gels from wild-type cells with those from clpP and clpX mutant cells revealed several changes in the protein pattern. Several proteins, such as GroEL, PpiB, PykA, SucD, YhfP, YqkF, YugJ and YvyD, which were found preferentially in higher amounts in both clpP and clpX mutants, might be potential substrates for the ClpXP protease.},

Using DNase I footprinting and gel-shift experiments, we identified two CodY-binding regions upstream of a B. subtilis gene (bcaP, previously known as yhdG) that encodes a transporter of branched-chain amino acids. Mutational analysis revealed that both CodY-binding regions contribute to repression in vivo and do so independently of each other. Thus, a single CodY-binding site is apparently sufficient for substantial CodY-dependent regulation. By analyzing affinities of wild-type and mutant CodY-binding sites for CodY and their regulation by wild-type CodY and forms of CodY with various levels of activation by branched-chain amino acids, we concluded that unliganded CodY cannot repress transcription in vivo and that the level of endogenously produced effectors is sufficient for CodY-mediated regulation of promoters with stronger sites. Because the sites with higher affinity apparently respond to lower concentrations of CodY effectors and saturate faster as the concentrations of effectors increase, having two sites of binding with different affinities for CodY permits a promoter to respond to a wider range of intracellular concentrations of effectors.},

	abstract = {The global transcriptional regulator, CodY, binds strongly to the regulatory region of the braB gene, which encodes a Bacillus subtilis branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) permease. However, under conditions that maximize CodY activity, braB expression was similar in wild-type and codY null mutant cells. Nonetheless, expression from the braB promoter was significantly elevated in cells containing partially active mutant versions of CodY or in wild-type cells under growth conditions leading to intermediate levels of CodY activity. This novel pattern of regulation was shown to be due to two opposing mechanisms, negative and positive, by which CodY affects braB expression. A strong CodY-binding site located downstream of the transcription start point conferred negative regulation by direct interaction with CodY. Additionally, sequences upstream and downstream of the promoter were required for repression by a second pleiotropic B. subtilis regulator, ScoC, whose own expression is repressed by CodY. ScoC-mediated repression of braB in codY null mutants cells was as efficient as direct, CodY-mediated repression in wild-type cells under conditions of high CodY activity. However, under conditions of reduced CodY activity, CodY-mediated repression was relieved to a greater extent than ScoC-mediated repression was increased, leading to elevated braB expression. We conclude that restricting increased expression of braB to conditions of moderate nutrient limitation is the raison d'être of the feed-forward regulatory loop formed by CodY and ScoC at the braB promoter. The increase in BraB expression only at intermediate activities of CodY may facilitate the uptake of BCAA when they are not in excess but prevent unneeded BraB synthesis when other BCAA transporters are active.},

	abstract = {CodY is a branched-chain amino acid-responsive transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of several dozen transcription units in Bacillus subtilis. The presence of isoleucine, valine, and leucine in the growth medium is essential for achieving high activity of CodY and for efficient regulation of the target genes. We identified three permeases-BcaP, BraB, and BrnQ-that are responsible for the bulk of isoleucine and valine uptake and are also involved in leucine uptake. At least one more permease is capable of efficient leucine uptake, as well as low-affinity transport of isoleucine and valine. The lack of the first three permeases strongly reduced activity of CodY in an amino acid-containing growth medium. BcaP appears to be the most efficient isoleucine and valine permease responsible for their utilization as nitrogen sources. The previously described strong CodY-mediated repression of BcaP provides a mechanism for fine-tuning CodY activity by reducing the availability of amino acids and for delaying the utilization of isoleucine and valine as nitrogen and carbon sources under conditions of nutrient excess.
IMPORTANCE: Bacillus subtilis CodY is a global transcriptional regulator that is activated by branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Since the level of BCAA achieved by intracellular synthesis is insufficient to fully activate CodY, transport of BCAA from the environment is critical for CodY activation, but the permeases needed for such activation have not been previously identified. This study identifies three such permeases, reports their amino acid transport specificity, and reveals their impact on CodY activation.},

	abstract = {Expression of PDX1.2 is regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family and is an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in most eudicots that is not utilized by monocots such as grasses., Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B6, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as models, we show that PDX1.2 is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic PDX1 homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B6 biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of PDX1.2 transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B6 homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.},

Enzymes accelerate the rates of such reactions by well over a million-fold, so reactions that would take years in the absence of catalysis can occur in fractions of seconds if catalyzed by the appropriate enzyme.

In the presence of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), GabR activates the transcription of gabT and gabD genes involved in GABA metabolism. Here we report a biochemical and atomic force microscopy characterization of Bacillus subtilis GabR in complex with DNA. Complexes were assembled in vitro to study their stoichiometry, stability and conformation. The fractional occupancy of the GabR cognate site suggests that GabR binds as a dimer with Kd of 10nM. Upon binding GabR bends the DNA by 80° as measured by anomalous electrophoretic mobility. With GABA we observed a decrease in affinity and conformational rearrangements compatible with a less compact nucleo-protein complex but no changes of the DNA bending angle. By employing promoter and GabR mutants we found that basic residues of the positively charged groove on the surface of the AT domain affect DNA affinity. The present data extend current understanding of the GabR-DNA interaction and the effect of GABA and PLP. A model for the GabR-DNA complex, corroborated by a docking simulation, is proposed. Characterization of the GabR DNA binding mode highlights the key role of DNA bending and interactions with bases outside the canonical direct repeats, and might be of general relevance for the action mechanism of MocR transcription factors.},

Saline solution was injected to to the control groups (CG-10, n = 12 for 10 days; CG-15, n = 12 for 15 days; CG-20, n=12 for 20 days). The three experimental groups (EG-10, n = 12; EG-15, n = 12; EG-20, n = 12) were treated with 5 mg/kg vitamin B6 daily for 10 days (EG-10), 15 days (EG-15) and 20 days (EG-20). Brain tissues were prepared by glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide double fixation for ultrastructural analysis. No significant changes were observed in the control groups. The ultrastructural analysis revealed that the numbers of damaged mitochondria, lipofuscin granules and vacuoles were significantly higher in all the experimental groups than in the control groups (p {\textless} 0.05). However, synaptic density was significantly decreased in the experimental groups as compared to the control groups (p {\textless} 0.05). The results suggest that the excess of vitamin B6 intake causes damage to the cerebral cortex due to cellular intoxication and decreased synaptic density. Thus, careful attention should be paid to the time and dose of vitamin B6 recommended for patients who are supplemented with this vitamin.},

These experiments offer empirical lessons about how proteins evolve in the face of clearly-defined laboratory selection pressures. Directed evolution has revealed that single amino acid mutations can enhance properties such as catalytic activity or stability and that adaptation can often occur through pathways consisting of sequential beneficial mutations. When there are no single mutations that improve a particular protein property experiments always find a wealth of mutations that are neutral with respect to the laboratory-defined measure of fitness. These neutral mutations can open new adaptive pathways by at least 2 different mechanisms. Functionally-neutral mutations can enhance a protein's stability, thereby increasing its tolerance for subsequent functionally beneficial but destabilizing mutations. They can also lead to changes in “promiscuous” functions that are not currently under selective pressure, but can subsequently become the starting points for the adaptive evolution of new functions. These lessons about the coupling between adaptive and neutral protein evolution in the laboratory offer insight into the evolution of proteins in nature.},

Systematic development of MRM assays is permitted by databases of peptide mass spectra and sequences, software tools for analysis design and data analysis, and rapid evolution of tandem mass spectrometer technology. Key advantages of MRM assays are the ability to target specific peptide sequences, including variants and modified forms, and the capacity for multiplexing that allows analysis of dozens to hundreds of peptides. Different quantitative standardization methods provide options that balance precision, sensitivity, and assay cost.

	abstract = {1) A vitamin-B6-producing mutant, BA 1, was selected by treatment of Bacillus subtilis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Using gradient plates supplemented with the vitamin B6 antagonist isonicotinohydrazide, three mutants of BA 1 were isolated, which excrete 2-5 mg of vitamin B6/l of growth medium. 2) Mutation of the three vitamin-B6-producing strains BA 1, BA 11 and L 71 led to the isolation of 49 vitamin-B6 deficient mutants. All mutants are able to grow with pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and even with 4'-deoxypyridoxine. Glycolaldehyde or nicotinic acid do not support growth of the mutants. Some of these vitamin-B6-deficient mutants can also grow in the absence of vitamin B6, providing isoleucine is present. Others show a growth stimulation, when isoleucine is added to a medium containing a vitamin B6 compound. Isoleucine can be replaced by 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate. Cross-feeding experiments indicated a division of the mutants into two groups. Using chromatographic methods, substances which support growth of the mutants were purified, but have not yet been identified. Following the addition of 4'-deoxypyridoxine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine 5'-phosphate was isolated from the growth medium of a vitamin B6-deficient mutant. 3) Threonine dehydratase, transaminase B and transaminase C from wild-type Bacillus subtilis were compared with the enzymes from vitamin-B6-producing strains and with the enzymes from vitamin-B6-deficient mutants. Both the vitamin-B6-producing and the vitamin B6-deficient mutants show higher specific activities than wild type. In the mutant strains no multivalent repression of the threonine dehydratase and transminase B by isoleucine, leucine and valine could be demonstrated. Leucine dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the isoleucine catabolic pathway, is constitutively produced in the vitamin-B6-producing and in the vitamin-B6-deficient mutants. In the vitamin-B6-deficient mutants, there is a correlation between growth yield in the presence of isoleucine and the specific activity of leucine dehydrogenase. In the crude extract of Bacillus subtilis no pyridoxamine-phosphate oxidase activity could be demonstrated, whereas pyridoxal kinase was readily detectable.},

In contrast, the metabolism of the earliest cellular life forms was likely much simpler with only a few enzymes of comparatively low activity. It has been speculated that these early enzymes had low specificities and in turn were able to perform multiple functions. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Ferla et al. describe examples of enzymes that catalyze chemically distinct reactions while using the same active site. Most importantly, the authors demonstrated that the comparatively weak activities of these multifunctional enzymes are each physiologically relevant. These findings contrast with simply promiscuous enzyme activities, which have been described numerous times but are not physiologically relevant. Ferla et al. elegantly combined initial bioinformatics searches for enzyme candidates with sound kinetic measurements, evolutionary considerations and even structural discussions. The phenomenon of multifunctionality appears to be a mechanism for bacteria with reduced genomes to compensate for their lack of certain enzymes. In the broader context of evolution, these organisms could be considered living model systems to study features of long-extinct early cellular life.},

	abstract = {Moonlighting proteins serve one or more novel functions in addition to their canonical roles. Moonlighting functions arise when an adventitious interaction between a protein and a new partner improves fitness of the organism. Selective pressure for improvement in the new function can result in two alternative outcomes. The gene encoding the newly bifunctional protein may duplicate and diverge so as to encode two proteins, each of which serves only one function. Alternatively, genetic changes that minimize adaptive conflict between the two functions and/or improve control over the time and place at which each function is served can lead to a moonlighting protein. Importantly, genetic changes that enhance a moonlighting function can occur in the gene encoding the moonlighting protein itself, in a gene that affects the structure of its new partner or in a gene encoding a transcription factor that controls expression of either partner. The evolutionary history of each moonlighting protein is complex, depending on the stochastic occurrence of genetic changes such as gene duplication and point mutations, and the effects of those changes on fitness. Population effects, particularly loss of promising individuals due to random genetic drift, also play a role in the emergence of a moonlighting protein. The ultimate outcome is not necessarily the 'optimal' solution to the problem of serving two functions, but may be 'good enough' so that fitness becomes limited by some other function.},

Although, enzyme is known for its specificity, many enzymes are reported to be promiscuous in nature. However, the promiscuous function may not be relevant in physiological conditions. The reasons could be either very low level of catalytic activity or unavailability of the substrates in the cell. Hitherto, the enzyme promiscuity is of great importance because they are the starting point for the evolution of new functions in the nature. In addition, the promiscuous activities are utilized for the development of new catalytic functions by applying directed laboratory evolution and protein engineering techniques. The aim of this review is to provide recent developments on the understanding of the mechanism of catalytic promiscuity, evolvability of promiscuous functions and the applications of enzyme promiscuity in the designing of enhanced or new functional biocatalysts.

	abstract = {An important problem in microbial ecology is to identify those phenotypic attributes that are responsible for competitive fitness in a particular environment. Thousands of papers have been published on the physiology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics of Escherichia coli and other bacterial models. Nonetheless, little is known about what makes one genotype a better competitor than another even in such well studied systems. Here, we review experiments to identify the phenotypic bases of improved competitive fitness in twelve E. coli populations that evolved for thousands of generations in a defined environment, in which glucose was the limiting substrate. After 10,000 generations, the average fitness of the derived genotypes had increased by approximately 50\% relative to the ancestor, based on competition experiments using marked strains in the same environment. The growth kinetics of the ancestral and derived genotypes showed that the latter have a shorter lag phase upon transfer into fresh medium and a higher maximum growth rate. Competition experiments were also performed in environments where other substrates were substituted for glucose. The derived genotypes are generally more fit in competition for those substrates that use the same mechanism of transport as glucose, which suggests that enhanced transport was an important target of natural selection in the evolutionary environment. All of the derived genotypes produce much larger cells than does the ancestor, even when both types are forced to grow at the same rate. Some but not all, of the derived genotypes also have greatly elevated mutation rates. Efforts are now underway to identify the genetic changes that underlie those phenotypic changes, especially substrate specificity and elevated mutation rate for which there are good candidate loci. Identification and subsequent manipulation of these genes may provide new insights into the reproducibility of adaptive evolution, the importance of co-adapted gene complexes, and the extent to which distinct phenotypes (e.g., substrate specificity and cell size) are affected by the same mutations.},

Our results corroborate computer simulations of mutator evolution in adapting clonal populations, and may help to explain observations that associate high mutation rates with emerging pathogens and with certain cancers.},

Both selective inhibition of Hsp90 and temperature stress increase correlations between genotype and phenotype.

These advances regard (i) the mechanism of catalytic promiscuity — how enzymes, that generally exert exquisite specificity, promiscuously catalyze other, and sometimes barely related, reactions; (ii) the evolvability of promiscuous functions — namely, how latent activities evolve further, and in particular, how promiscuous activities can firstly evolve without severely compromising the original activity. These findings have interesting implications on our understanding of how new enzymes evolve. They support the key role of catalytic promiscuity in the natural history of enzymes, and suggest that today's enzymes diverged from ancestral proteins catalyzing a whole range of activities at low levels, to create families and superfamilies of potent and highly specialized enzymes.},

	abstract = {Active transport of thiamin (vitamin B1) into Escherichia coli occurs through a member of the superfamily of transporters known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Although it was demonstrated that the sulfhydryl-specific modifier N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibited thiamin transport, the exact mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. Therefore, we have carried out a kinetic analysis of thiamin transport to determine the mechanism of inhibition by NEM. Thiamin transport in vivo exhibits Michaelis–Menten kinetics with KM=15 nM and Vmax=46 U mg−1. Treatment of intact E. coli KG33 with saturating NEM exhibited apparent noncompetitive inhibition, decreasing Vmax by approximately 50\% without effecting KM or the apparent first-order rate constant (kobsd). Apparent noncompetitive inhibition is consistent with an irreversible covalent modification of a cysteine(s) that is critical for the transport process. A primary amino acid analysis of the subunits of the thiamin permease combined with our kinetic analysis suggests that inhibition of thiamin transport by NEM is different from other ABC transporters and occurs at the level of protein–protein interactions between the membrane-bound carrier protein and the ATPase subunit.},

To date, the evidence for the formation of AHAP, while self-consistent, has been largely circumstantial, and does not exclude the possibility that the actual product of the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of HTP might be 2-amino-3-oxo-4-hydroxybutyric acid 4-phosphate which could undergo rapid, non-enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation once released from the protein. Use of negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometric analysis (MS-MS) confirms that AHAP is the product of the PdxA-catalyzed reaction.},

In 1934, Paul György showed that the factor which cured 'rat acrodynia' was vitamin B(6). Other studies soon showed that vitamin B(6) deficiency produced convulsions in rats, pigs, and dogs, and a microcytic anemia in certain animals. Samuel Lepkovsky isolated and crystallized vitamin B(6) in 1938. The following year, Leslie Harris and Karl Folkers, and Richard Kuhn and his associates independently showed that vitamin B(6) was a pyridine derivative, 3-hydroxy-4,5-dihydroxy-methyl-2-methyl-pyridine. György proposed the term pyridoxine for this derivative. Esmond Snell developed a microbiological growth assay in 1942 that led to the characterization of pyridoxamine, the animated product of pyridoxine, and pyridoxal, the formyl derivative of pyridoxine. Further studies showed that pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine have largely equal activity in animals and owe their vitamin activity to the ability of the organism to convert them into the enzymatically active form pyridoxal-5-phosphate. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate plays a role in a wide variety of enzyme systems, especially in the metabolic utilization and transformation of amino acids.},

Adaptive laboratory evolution has some major benefits as compared with classical genetic engineering but also some inherent limitations. However, recent studies show how some of the limitations may be overcome in order to successfully incorporate adaptive laboratory evolution in microbial cell factory design. Over the last two decades important insights into nutrient and stress metabolism of relevant model species were acquired, whereas some other aspects such as niche-specific differences of non-conventional cell factories are not completely understood.

	abstract = {Comparative analysis of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic genomes indicates that a significant fraction of the genes in the prokaryotic genomes have been subject to horizontal transfer. In some cases, the amount and source of horizontal gene transfer can be linked to an organism's lifestyle. For example, bacterial hyperthermophiles seem to have exchanged genes with archaea to a greater extent than other bacteria, whereas transfer of certain classes of eukaryotic genes is most common in parasitic and symbiotic bacteria. Horizontal transfer events can be classified into distinct categories of acquisition of new genes, acquisition of paralogs of existing genes, and xenologous gene displacement whereby a gene is displaced by a horizontally transferred ortholog from another lineage (xenolog). Each of these types of horizontal gene transfer is common among prokaryotes, but their relative contributions differ in different lineages. The fixation and long-term persistence of horizontally transferred genes suggests that they confer a selective advantage on the recipient organism. In most cases, the nature of this advantage remains unclear, but detailed examination of several cases of acquisition of eukaryotic genes by bacteria seems to reveal the evolutionary forces involved. Examples include isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases whose acquisition from eukaryotes by several bacteria is linked to antibiotic resistance, ATP/ADP translocases acquired by intracellular parasitic bacteria, Chlamydia and Rickettsia, apparently from plants, and proteases that may be implicated in chlamydial pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Vitamin B6 in its active form pyridoxal phosphate is an essential coenzyme of many diverse enzymes. Biochemistry, enzymology and genetics of de novo vitamin B6 biosynthesis have been primarily investigated in Escherichia coli. Database searches revealed that the key enzymes involved in ring closure of the aromatic pyridoxin ring (PdxA; PdxJ) are present mainly in genomes of bacteria constituting the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. The distribution of DXS, a transketolase-like enzyme involved in vitamin B6 biosynthesis as well as in thiamine and isoprenoid biosynthesis and the distribution of vitamin B6 modifying enzymes (PdxH: oxidase; PdxK: kinase) was also analyzed. These enzymes are also present in the genomes of animals. Two recent papers (Ehrenshaft et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 96: 9374-9378; Osmani et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274: 23565-23569) show the involvement of an extremely conserved protein (a member of the UPF0019 or SNZ family) found in all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, eukarya) in an alternative vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway. Members of this family were previously identified as a stationary phase inducible protein in yeast, as an ethylene responsible protein in plants and in a marine sponge, as a singlet oxygen resistance protein in Cercospora nicotianae and as a cumene hydroperoxide and H2O2 inducible protein in Bacillus subtilis. In yeast, the SNZ protein interacts with another protein called SNO which also represents a member of a highly conserved protein family (called UPF0030 or SNO family). Phylogenetic trees for the DXS, PdxA, PdxJ, PdxH, PdxK, SNZ and SNO protein families are presented and possible implications of the two different vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathways in cellular metabolism are discussed. A radically different view of bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 26: 111-131) which proposes a linear rather than a treelike evolutionary relationship between procaryotic species indicates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. This proposal might help to explain why the PdxA/PdxJ pathway is largely restricted to this subdivision.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msi011},
	abstract = {Vitamin B(6) (VB6) functions as a cofactor of many diverse enzymes in amino acid metabolism. Three metabolic pathways for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP; the active form of VB6) are known: the de novo pathway, the salvage pathway, and the fungal type pathway. Most unicellular organisms and plants biosynthesize VB6 using one or two of these three biosynthetic pathways. However, animals such as insects and mammals do not possess any of the pathways and, thus, need to intake VB6 in their diet to survive. It is conceivable that breakdowns of these pathways occurred in the evolutionary lineages of insects and mammals, and one of the major reasons for this would be the loss of pertinent genes. We studied the evolution of VB6 biosynthesis from the view of the gain and loss of 10 pertinent genes in 122 species whose genome sequences were completely determined. The results revealed that each gene in the pathways was lost more than once in the entire evolutionary lineages of the 122 species. We also found the following three points regarding the evolution of PLP biosynthesis: (1) the breakdown of the PLP biosynthetic pathways occurred independently at least three times in animal lineages, (2) the de novo pathway was formed by the generation of pdxB in gamma-proteobacteria, and (3) the order of the gene loss in VB6 metabolism was conserved among different evolutionary lineages. These results suggest that the evolution of VB6 metabolism was subject to gains and frequent losses of related genes in the 122 species examined. This dynamic nature of the evolutionary changes must have been responsible for the breakdowns of the pathways, resulting in profound differentiation of heterotrophy among the species.},

	abstract = {The biologically active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), is a cofactor in over 160 enzyme activities involved in a number of metabolic pathways, including neurotransmitter synthesis and degradation. In humans, PLP is recycled from food and from degraded PLP-dependent enzymes in a salvage pathway requiring the action of pyridoxal kinase, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase and phosphatases. Once pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is made, it is targeted to the dozens different apoenzymes that need it as a cofactor. The regulation of the salvage pathway and the mechanism of addition of PLP to the apoenzymes are poorly understood and represent a very challenging research field. Severe neurological disorders, such as convulsions and epileptic encephalopathy, result from a reduced availability of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in the cell, due to inborn errors in the enzymes of the salvage pathway or other metabolisms and to interactions of drugs with PLP or pyridoxal kinase. Multifactorial neurological pathologies, such as autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy have also been correlated to inadequate intracellular levels of PLP.},

Here, we report cloning of a gene designated pdxR that functionally corresponds to the pdxB gene of E. coli and encodes a dye-linked flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent 4-phospho-d-erythronate (4PE) dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of 4PE to 3-hydroxy-4-phosphohydroxy-α-ketobutyrate and is clearly different in terms of cofactor requirements from the pdxB gene product of E. coli, which is known to be an NAD-dependent enzyme. Previously, we revealed that in S. meliloti IFO 14782, 4PHT is synthesized from 4-hydroxy-l-threonine and that this synthesis starts with glycolaldehyde and glycine. However, in this study, we identified a second 4PHT pathway in S. meliloti that originates exclusively from glycolaldehyde (the major pathway). Based on the involvement of 4PE in the 4PHT pathway, the incorporation of different samples of 13C-labeled glycolaldehyde into pyridoxine molecules was examined using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. On the basis of the spectral analyses, the synthesis of 4PHT from glycolaldehyde was hypothesized to involve the following steps: glycolaldehyde is sequentially metabolized to d-erythrulose, d-erythrulose 4-phosphate, and d-erythrose 4-phosphate by transketolase, kinase, and isomerase, respectively; and d-erythrose 4-phosphate is then converted to 4PHT by the conventional three-step pathway elucidated in E. coli, although the mechanism of action of the enzymes catalyzing the first two steps is different.},

	abstract = {pdrK encodes a pyridoxine (PN)/pyridoxal (PL)/pyridoxamine (PM) kinase thought to function in the salvage pathway of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) coenzyme biosynthesis. The observation that pdxK null mutants still contain PL kinase activity led to the hypothesis that Escherichia coli K-12 contains at least one other B6-vitamer kinase. Here we support this hypothesis by identifying the pdxY gene (formally, open reading frame f287b) at 36.92 min, which encodes a novel PL kinase. PdxY was first identified by its homology to PdxK in searches of the complete E. coli genome. Minimal clones of pdxY+ overexpressed PL kinase specific activity about 10-fold. We inserted an omega cassette into pdxY and crossed the resulting pdxY::omegaKan(r) mutation into the bacterial chromosome of a pdrB mutant, in which de novo PLP biosynthesis is blocked. We then determined the growth characteristics and PL and PN kinase specific activities in extracts of pdxK and pdxY single and double mutants. Significantly, the requirement of the pdxB pdxK pdxY triple mutant for PLP was not satisfied by PL and PN, and the triple mutant had negligible PL and PN kinase specific activities. Our combined results suggest that the PL kinase PdxY and the PN/PL/PM kinase PdxK are the only physiologically important B6 vitamer kinases in E. coli and that their function is confined to the PLP salvage pathway. Last, we show that pdxY is located downstream from pdxH (encoding PNP/PMP oxidase) and essential tyrS (encoding aminoacyl-tRNA(Tyr) synthetase) in a multifunctional operon. pdxY is completely cotranscribed with tyrS, but about 92\% of tyrS transcripts terminate at a putative Rho-factor-dependent attenuator located in the tyrS-pdxY intercistronic region.},

The enzyme encoded by pdxH was overexpressed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by four steps of column chromatography. The purified PdxH enzyme is a thermally stable 51-kDa homodimer containing one molecule of flavin mononucleotide (FMN). In the presence of molecular oxygen, the PdxH enzyme uses PNP or PMP as a substrate (Km = 2 and 105 microM and kcat = 0.76 and 1.72 s-1 for PNP and PMP, respectively) and produces hydrogen peroxide. Thus, under aerobic conditions, the PdxH enzyme acts as a classical monofunctional flavoprotein oxidase with an extremely low kcat turnover number. Comparison of kcat/Km values suggests that PNP rather than PMP is the in vivo substrate of E. coli PdxH oxidase. In contrast, the eukaryotic enzyme has similar kcat/Km values for PNP and PMP and seems to act as a scavenger. E. coli PNP/PMP oxidase activities were competitively inhibited by the pathway end product, PLP, and by the analog, 4-deoxy-PNP, with Ki values of 8 and 105 microM, respectively. Immunoinhibition studies suggested that the catalytic domain of the enzyme may be composed of discontinuous residues on the polypeptide sequence. Two independent quantitation methods showed that PNP/PMP oxidase was present in about 700 to 1,200 dimer enzyme molecules per cell in E. coli growing exponentially in minimal medium plus glucose at 37 degrees C. Thus, E. coli PNP/PMP oxidase is an example of a relatively abundant, but catalytically sluggish, enzyme committed to PLP coenzyme biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Vitamins have traditionally played the role of coenzymes, organic molecules that facilitate the chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. However, several vitamins assume additional endocrine-like actions; this review will discuss four such vitamins. Vitamin K2 is involved in the gamma-carboxylation of coagulation factors and bone proteins, but it can also bind and activate the steroid and xenobiotic receptor in order to mediate transcription in bone tissue, and has been used to treat osteoporosis. Biotin is critical for some carboxylation reactions, but it also induces epidermal differentiation and has been used to treat lameness in animals and brittle nails in humans. Pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) is involved in a multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation and transamination; it can also inhibit DNA polymerases and several steroid receptors and may prove useful as an adjunct in cancer chemotherapy. Finally, nicotinic acid is converted to NAD+ and NADP+, which are used as hydrogen/electron carriers in redox reactions. However, it also possesses vasodilatory and antilipolytic activities.},

	abstract = {The proteome of growing cells of Bacillus subtilis was analyzed in order to provide the basis for its application in microbial physiology. DNA arrays were used to calculate the number of genes transcribed in growing cells. From the 4100 B. subtilis genes, 2515 were actively transcribed in cells grown under standard conditions. From these genes 1544 proteins should be covered by our standard gel system pI 4-7. Using this standard gel system and supplementary zoom gels (pI 5.5-6.7, 5-6, 4.5-5.5, and 4-5) 693 proteins which are expressed in growing cells were detected that cover more than 40\% of the vegetative proteome predicted for this region. Particularly broad coverage and thus comprehensive monitoring will be possible for central carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, and citric acid cycle), amino acid synthesis pathways, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and main cellular functions like replication, transcription, translation, and cell wall synthesis. Comparing the theoretical pI and Mr values with those experimentally determined a reasonable correlation was found for the majority of protein spots. By a color code outliers with dramatic deviations in charge or mass were visualized that may indicate post-translational modifications. In addition to the cytosolic neutral and alkaline proteins, 130 membrane proteins were found relying on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation in combination with electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) techniques. The vegetative proteome containing 876 proteins in total is now ready for physiological applications. Two main proteome fractions (pI 4-7 and zoom gel pI 4.5-5.5) should be sufficient for such high-throughput physiological proteomics.},

This study of five patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy suggests that the same is true in man. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine analyses indicated reduced activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and other PLP-dependent enzymes. Seizures ceased with the administration of PLP, having been resistant to treatment with pyridoxine, suggesting a defect of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Sequencing of the PNPO gene identified homozygous missense, splice site and stop codon mutations. Expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the splice site (IVS3-1g{\textgreater}a) and stop codon (X262Q) mutations were null activity mutations and that the missense mutation (R229W) markedly reduced pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase activity. Maintenance of optimal PLP levels in the brain may be important in many neurological disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed (either as a primary or as a secondary phenomenon).},

One such compound, bacillaene, is a linear polyketide/nonribosomal peptide. The pks genes encode the enzymatic megacomplex that synthesizes bacillaene. The majority of pks genes appear to be organized as a giant operon ({\textgreater}74 kb from pksC-pksR). In previous work (P. D. Straight, M. A. Fischbach, C. T. Walsh, D. Z. Rudner, and R. Kolter, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104:305–310, 2007, doi:10.1073/pnas.0609073103), a deletion of the pks operon in B. subtilis was found to induce prodiginine production by Streptomyces coelicolor. Here, colonies of wild-type B. subtilis formed a spreading population that induced prodiginine production from Streptomyces lividans, suggesting differential regulation of pks genes and, as a result, bacillaene. While the parent colony showed widespread induction of pks expression among cells in the population, we found the spreading cells uniformly and transiently repressed the expression of the pks genes. To identify regulators that control pks genes, we first determined the pattern of pks gene expression in liquid culture. We next identified mutations in regulatory genes that disrupted the wild-type pattern of pks gene expression. We found that expression of the pks genes requires the master regulator of development, Spo0A, through its repression of AbrB and the stationary-phase regulator, CodY. Deletions of degU, comA, and scoC had moderate effects, disrupting the timing and level of pks gene expression. The observed patterns of expression suggest that complex regulation of bacillaene and other antibiotics optimizes competitive fitness for B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {Bacteria switch between free-living and a multicellular state, known as biofilms, in response to cellular and environmental cues. It is important to understand how these cues influence biofilm development as biofilms are not only ubiquitous in nature but are also causative agents of infectious diseases. It is often believed that any stress triggers biofilm formation as a means of bacterial protection. In this study, we propose a new mechanism for how cellular and environmental DNA damage may influence biofilm formation. We demonstrate that Bacillus subtilis prevents biofilm formation and cell differentiation when stressed by oxidative DNA damage. We show that during B. subtilis biofilm development, a subpopulation of cells accumulates reactive oxygen species, which triggers the DNA damage response. Surprisingly, DNA damage response induction shuts off matrix genes whose products permit individual cells to stick together within a biofilm. We further revealed that DDRON cells and matrix producers are mutually exclusive and spatially separated within the biofilm, and that a developmental checkpoint protein, Sda, mediates the exclusiveness. We believe this represents an alternative survival strategy, ultimately allowing cells to escape the multicellular community when in danger. Exposure to chemicals that damage DNA makes Bacillus subtilis bacteria turn off genes that maintain the biofilm state, releasing some bacteria. This mechanism to free cells from a biofilm is surprising, as biofilms holding bacteria together are generally considered to form as a protective mechanism for the bacteria. Yunrong Chai and colleagues at Northeastern University in Boston, USA, detected the surprising behavior in biofilms exposed to superoxide—a chemical species that damages DNA. They suggest that when the potential for damage to bacterial DNA reaches a threshold it signals that the environment is not suitable for cells to remain in the entrapped biofilm form, triggering disruption of the biofilm as a survival strategy. This response to DNA damage may be relevant to clinical conditions as biofilms are involved in many infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {The sigmaB transcription factor of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is activated by growth-limiting energy or environmental challenge to direct the synthesis of more than 100 general stress proteins. Although the signal transduction pathway that conveys these stress signals to sigmaB is becoming increasingly well understood, how environmental or energy stress signals enter this pathway remains unknown. We show here that two PP2C serine phosphatases - RsbP, which is required for response to energy stress, and RsbU, which is required for response to environmental stress - each converge on the RsbV regulator of sigmaB. According to the current understanding of sigmaB regulation, in unstressed cells the phosphorylated RsbV anti-anti-sigma is unable to complex the RsbW anti-sigma, which is then free to bind and inactivate sigmaB. We can now advance the model that either PP2C phosphatase, when triggered by its particular class of stress, can remove the phosphate from RsbV and thereby activate sigmaB. The action of the previously described RsbU is known to be controlled by dedicated upstream signalling components that are activated by environmental stress. The action of the RsbP phosphatase described here requires an energy stress, which we suggest is sensed, at least in part, by the PAS domain in the amino-terminal region of the RsbP phosphatase. In other bacterial signalling proteins, similar PAS domains and their associated chromophores directly sense changes in intracellular redox potential to control the activity of a linked output domain.},

The activity of sigma B is controlled in part by RsbW, a protein that inhibits sigma B, and RsbV, a protein that counteracts this inhibition. We now demonstrate that purified RsbW is capable of forming alternative complexes with either sigma B or RsbV. Sigma B in the RsbW. sigma B complex was transcriptionally inactive. RsbV reversed this inhibition by sequestering RsbW in a RsbW-RsbV complex, thereby allowing sigma B to remain free and active. In contrast to interactions among the components of the homologous regulatory system for the sporulation transcription factor sigma F, the binding of RsbW to RsbV and sigma B did not require adenosine nucleotides. Experiments involving the exchange of proteins between the two regulatory systems demonstrated that RsbW and its homolog in the sigma F system, SpoIIAB, exhibit strong preference in binding to RsbV and sigma B, and SpoIIAA and sigma F, respectively, and that the difference in nucleotide-dependence of binding between these two systems is attributable to a difference between RsbW and SpoIIAB. In confirmation and extension of previous results, we show that RsbW is also a protein kinase that uses ATP to phosphorylate RsbV, thereby blocking the capacity of RsbV to bind to RsbW and activate transcription. A close correlation was observed between the concentration of ATP required for efficient RsbW-mediated phosphorylation of RsbV, inhibition of RsbW.RsbV comlex formation, and inhibition of sigma B-directed transcription. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of sigma B under certain stress condition is due to a decrease in cellular ATP levels.},

We show that this network comprises two partner-switching modules, RsbX-RsbS-RsbT and RsbU-RsbV-RsbW, which contribute to regulating sigma(B). Each module consists of a phosphatase (X or U), an antagonist protein (S or V), and a switch protein/kinase (T or W). In the downstream module, the W anti-sigma factor is the primary regulator of sigma(B) activity. If the V antagonist is phosphorylated, the W switch protein binds and inhibits sigma(B). If V is unphosphorylated, it complexes W, freeing sigma(B) to interact with RNA polymerase and promote transcription. The phosphorylation state of V is controlled by opposing kinase (W) and phosphatase (U) activities. The U phosphatase is regulated by the upstream module. The T switch protein directly binds U, stimulating phosphatase activity. The T-U interaction is governed by the phosphorylation state of the S antagonist, controlled by opposing kinase (T) and phosphatase (X) activities.

Under stress conditions, the phosphatase RsbU triggers release of sigma(B) and thus induces the expression of stress genes. RsbU activity is controlled by three proteins, RsbR, RsbS and RsbT which form a supramolecular complex called the stressosome. Here we review the occurrence of the genes encoding the stressosome proteins (called the RsbRST module) in a wide variety of bacteria. While this module is linked to the gene encoding sigma(B) and its direct regulators in B. subtilis and its close relatives, genes encoding two-component regulatory systems and more complex phosphorelays are clustered with the RsbRST module in bacteria as diverse as cyanobacteria, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and deinococci. The conservation of the RsbRST module and its clustering with different types of regulatory systems suggest that the stressosome proteins form a signal sensing and transduction unit that relays information to very different output modules.},

RsbW is the primary inhibitor of this system with the other gene products acting upstream of RsbW in the sigma B regulatory pathway. Evidence is now presented that RsbW inhibits sigma B-dependent transcription by binding to sigma B and blocking the formation of a sigma B-containing RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Antibodies specific for either RsbW or sigma B will coprecipitate both proteins from crude cell extracts. This is not due to the presence of both proteins on RNA polymerase. Western blot analysis of B. subtilis extracts that had been fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography revealed a single peak of RsbW that did not coelute with RNA polymerase and two peaks of sigma B protein: one that eluted with RNA polymerase and a second that overlapped the fractions that contained RsbW. Reconstitution experiments were performed in which partially purified sigma B and RsbW were added to core RNA polymerase and tested for their ability to influence the transcription of a sigma B-dependent promoter (ctc) in vitro. RsbW efficiently blocked sigma B-dependent transcription but only if it was incubated with sigma B prior to the addition of the core enzyme.},

	abstract = {DNA-dependent multisubunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the key enzyme of gene expression and a target of regulation in all kingdoms of life. It is a complex multifunctional molecular machine which, unlike other DNA-binding proteins, engages in extensive and dynamic interactions (both specific and nonspecific) with DNA, and maintains them over a distance. These interactions are controlled by DNA sequences, DNA topology, and a host of regulatory factors. Here we summarize key recent structural and biochemical studies that elucidate the fine details of RNAP-DNA interactions during initiation. The findings of these studies help unravel the molecular mechanisms of promoter recognition and open complex formation, initiation of transcript synthesis and promoter escape. We also discuss most current advances in the studies of drugs that specifically target RNAP-DNA interactions during transcription initiation and elongation.},

	abstract = {Bacterial promoters are recognized by RNA polymerase (RNAP) σ subunit, which specifically interacts with the ?10 and ?35 promoter elements. Here, we provide evidence that the ?? zipper, an evolutionarily conserved loop of the largest subunit of RNAP core, interacts with promoter spacer, a DNA segment that separates the ?10 and ?35 promoter elements, and facilitates the formation of stable closed promoter complex. Depending on the spacer sequence, the proposed interaction of the ?? zipper with the spacer can also facilitate open promoter complex formation and even substitute for interactions of the σ subunit with the ?35 element. These results suggest that there exists a novel class of promoters that rely on interaction of the ?? zipper with promoter spacer, along with or instead of interactions of σ subunit with the ?35 element, for their activity. Finally, our data suggest that sequence-dependent interactions of the ?? zipper with DNA can contribute to promoter-proximal σ-dependent RNAP pausing, a recently recognized important step of transcription control.},

	abstract = {Bacterial lipoproteins are peripherally anchored membrane proteins that play a variety of roles in bacterial physiology and virulence in monoderm (single membrane-enveloped, e.g., gram-positive) and diderm (double membrane-enveloped, e.g., gram-negative) bacteria. After export of prolipoproteins through the cytoplasmic membrane, which occurs predominantly but not exclusively via the general secretory or Sec pathway, the proteins are lipid-modified at the cytoplasmic membrane in a multistep process that involves sequential modification of a cysteine residue and cleavage of the signal peptide by the signal II peptidase Lsp. In both monoderms and diderms, signal peptide processing is preceded by acylation with a diacylglycerol through preprolipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (Lgt). In diderms but also some monoderms, lipoproteins are further modified with a third acyl chain through lipoprotein N-acyl transferase (Lnt). Fully modified lipoproteins that are destined to be anchored in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (OM) are selected, transported and inserted by the Lol (lipoprotein outer membrane localization) pathway machinery, which consists of the inner-membrane (IM) ABC transporter-like LolCDE complex, the periplasmic LolA chaperone and the OM LolB lipoprotein receptor. Retention of lipoproteins in the cytoplasmic membrane results from Lol avoidance signals that were originally described as the “+2 rule”. Surface localization of lipoproteins in diderms is rare in most bacteria, with the exception of several spirochetal species. Type 2 (T2SS) and type 5 (T5SS) secretion systems are involved in secretion of specific surface lipoproteins of γ-proteobacteria. In the model spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, surface lipoprotein secretion does not follow established sorting rules, but remains dependent on N-terminal peptide sequences. Secretion through the outer membrane requires maintenance of lipoproteins in a translocation-competent unfolded conformation, likely through interaction with a periplasmic holding chaperone, which delivers the proteins to an outer membrane lipoprotein flippase.

	abstract = {The ability of Listeria monocytogenes to invade non-phagocytic cells is important for development of a systemic listeriosis infection. The authors previously reported that a L. monocytogenes Delta sigB strain is defective in invasion into human intestinal epithelial cells, in part, due to decreased expression of a major invasion gene, inlA. To characterize additional invasion mechanisms under the control of sigmaB, mutants were generated carrying combinations of in-frame deletions in inlA, inlB and sigB. Quantitative assessment of bacterial invasion into the human enterocyte Caco-2 and hepatocyte HepG-2 cell lines demonstrated that sigmaB contributes to both InlA and InlB-mediated invasion of L. monocytogenes. Previous identification of the sigmaB-dependent P2(prfA) promoter upstream of the major virulence gene regulator, positive regulatory factor A (PrfA), suggested that the contributions of sigmaB to expression of various virulence genes, including inlA, could be at least partially mediated through PrfA. To test this hypothesis, relative invasion capabilities of Delta sigB and Delta prfA strains were compared. Exponential-phase cells of the Delta sigB and Delta prfA strains were similarly defective at invasion; however, stationary-phase Delta sigB cells were significantly less invasive than stationary-phase DeltaprfA cells, suggesting that the contributions of sigmaB to invasion extend beyond those mediated through PrfA in stationary-phase L. monocytogenes. TaqMan quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCRs further demonstrated that expression of inlA and inlB was greatly increased in a sigmaB-dependent manner in stationary-phase L. monocytogenes. Together, results from this study provide strong biological evidence of a critical role for sigmaB in L. monocytogenes invasion into non-phagocytic cells, primarily mediated through control of inlA and inlB expression.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) are persistent pathogenic bacteria characterized by slow growth and, for many of these strains, an increased ability to form biofilms and to persist within host cells. The virulence-associated gene expression profile of SCVs clearly differs from that of prototypical strains and is often influenced by SigB rather than by the agr system. One objective of this work was to confirm the role of SigB in the control of the expression of virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and intracellular persistence of SCVs. This study shows that extracellular proteins are involved in the formation of biofilm by three SCV strains, which, additionally, have a low biofilm-dispersing activity. It was determined that SigB activity modulates biofilm formation by strain SCV CF07-S and is dominant over that of the agr system without being solely responsible for the repression of proteolytic activity. On the other hand, the expression of fnbA and the control of nuclease activity contributed to the SigB-dependent formation of biofilm of this SCV strain. SigB was also required for the replication of CF07-S within epithelial cells and may be involved in the colonization of lungs by SCVs in a mouse infection model. This study methodically investigated SigB activity and associated mechanisms in the various aspects of SCV pathogenesis. Results confirm that SigB activity importantly influences the production of virulence factors, biofilm formation and intracellular persistence for some clinical SCV strains.},

However, very little is known about how these PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and exhibit the antifungal response. Here, we report the antagonistic interaction between Bacillus subtilis and the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides We demonstrate that this bacterial-fungal interaction triggers the induction of the SigB transcription factor, the master regulator of B. subtilis stress adaptation. Dual-growth experiments performed with live or dead mycelia or culture supernatants of F. verticillioides showed that SigB was activated and required for the biocontrol of fungal growth. Mutations in the different regulatory pathways of SigB activation in the isogenic background revealed that only the energy-related RsbP-dependent arm of SigB activation was responsible for specific fungal detection and triggering the antagonistic response. The activation of SigB increased the expression of the operon responsible for the production of the antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (the srfA operon). SigB-deficient B. subtilis cultures produced decreased amounts of surfactin, and B. subtilis cultures defective in surfactin production (ΔsrfA) were unable to control the growth of F. verticillioidesIn vivo experiments of seed germination efficiency and early plant growth inhibition in the presence of F. verticillioides confirmed the physiological importance of SigB activity for plant bioprotection.IMPORTANCE Biological control using beneficial bacteria (PGPRs) represents an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to pesticides for controlling plant diseases. Different PGPR Bacillus species produce potent biofungicides and stimulate plant defense responses against phytopathogenic fungi. However, very little is known about how PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and process the antifungal response. Here, we report how B. subtilis triggers the induction of the stress-responsive sigma B transcription factor and the synthesis of the lipopeptide surfactin to fight the phytopathogen. Our findings show the participation of the stress-responsive regulon of PGPR Bacillus in the detection and biocontrol of a phytopathogenic fungus of agronomic impact.},

We report the response of Bacillus subtilis to bacitracin, an inhibitor of cell wall biosynthesis found in its natural environment. Analysis of the global transcriptional profile of bacitracin-treated cells reveals a response orchestrated by two alternative sigma factors (sigmaB and sigmaM) and three two-component systems (YvqEC, YvcPQ and BceRS). All three two-component systems are located next to target genes that are strongly induced by bacitracin, and the corresponding histidine kinases share an unusual topology: they lack about 100 amino acids in their extracellular sensing domain, which is almost entirely buried in the cytoplasmic membrane. Sequence analysis indicates that this novel N-terminal sensing domain is a characteristic feature of a subfamily of histidine kinases, found almost entirely in Gram-positive bacteria and frequently linked to ABC transporters. A systematic mutational analysis of bacitracin-induced genes led to the identification of a new bacitracin-resistance determinant, bceAB, encoding a putative ABC transporter. The bcrC bacitracin resistance gene, which is under the dual control of sigmaX and sigmaM, was also induced by bacitracin. By comparing the bacitracin and the vancomycin stimulons, we can differentiate between loci induced specifically by bacitracin and those that are induced by multiple cell wall-active antibiotics.},

Three members of the PerR regulon (katA, mrgA, and zosA) were strongly induced by H2O2 and weakly induced by t-buOOH. The remaining members of the PerR regulon were only modestly up-regulated by peroxide treatment. Overall, the magnitude of peroxide induction of PerR regulon genes corresponded well with the extent of derepression in a perR mutant strain. The σB regulon was activated by 58 μM H2O2 but not by 8 μM H2O2 and was strongly activated by either t-buOOH or, in a control experiment, tert-butyl alcohol. Apart from the σB regulon there was a single gene, ohrA, that was strongly and rapidly induced by t-buOOH exposure.

A total of 366 and 400 genes were identified as significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. We found excess Fe(3+) had four major influences on B. subtilis: Fe(3+) resulted in oxidative stress and induced genes involved in oxidative stress resistance including the SigB-regulated genes, but the PerR regulon was not inducible in Fe(3+)-mediated oxidative stress except zosA; Fe(3+) significantly disturbed homeostasis of Mn(2+) and Zn(2+), and the mechanism was proposed in this article; the acidity of Fe(3+)-induced genes involved in acid consuming and production of bases and shifted B. subtilis to carbon starvation state; Fe(3+)-induced genes related to membrane remodeling (bkd operon), which prevents Fe(3+)'s incorporation to membrane lipids. Moreover, Fe(3+) repressed the stringent control response, consistent with the induction of stringent control in iron limitation, demonstrating that iron might be a signal in stringent control of B. subtilis.

The 2D gels only depict single moments during the cells' growth cycle, but a sequential series of overlays obtained at specific points of the growth curve facilitates visualization of the developmental processes at the proteomics scale. During glucose starvation a substantial reprogramming of the protein synthesis pattern was found, with 150 proteins synthesized de novo and cessation of the synthesis of almost 400 proteins. Proteins induced following glucose starvation belong to two main regulation groups: general stress/starvation responses induced by different stresses or starvation stimuli (sigma(B)-dependent general stress regulon, stringent response, sporulation), and glucose-starvation-specific responses (drop in glycolysis, utilization of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis). Using the dual channel approach, it was not only possible to identify those regulons or stimulons, but also to follow the fate of each single protein by the three-color code: red, newly induced but not yet accumulated; yellow, synthesized and accumulated; and green, still present, but no longer being synthesized. These green proteins, which represent a substantial part of the protein pool in the nongrowing cell, are not accessible by using DNA arrays. The combination of 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry with the dual channel imaging technique provides a new and comprehensive view of the physiology of growing or starving bacterial cell populations, here for the case of the glucose-starvation response.},

In this study, we investigated the impact of a null mutation in sigB on the stress and starvation survival of B. subtilis. sigB mutants which failed to induce the regulon following stress displayed an at least 50- to 100-fold decrease in survival of severe heat (54°C) or ethanol (9\%) shock, salt (10\%) stress, and acid (pH 4.3) stress, as well as freezing and desiccation, compared to the wild type. Preloading cells with ςB-dependent general stress proteins prior to growth-inhibiting stress conferred considerable protection against heat and salt. Exhaustion of glucose or phosphate induced the ςB response, but surprisingly, ςB did not seem to be required for starvation survival. Starved wild-type cells exhibited about 10-fold greater resistance to salt stress than exponentially growing cells. The data argue that the expression of ςB-dependent genes provides nonsporulated B. subtilis cells with a nonspecific multiple stress resistance that may be relevant for stress survival in the natural ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis sigma-B is an alternate sigma factor implicated in controlling stationary-phase gene expression. We characterized the genetic organization and regulation of the region containing the sigma-B structural gene (sigB) to learn which metabolic signals and protein factors govern sigma-B function. sigB lay in an operon with four open reading frames (orfs) in the order orfV-orfW-sigB-orfX, and lacZ gene fusions showed that all four frames were translated in vivo. Experiments with primer extension, S1 nuclease mapping, and lacZ transcriptional fusions found that sigB operon transcription initiated early in stationary phase from a site 32 nucleotides upstream of orfV and terminated 34 nucleotides downstream of orfX. Fusion expression was abolished in a strain carrying an in-frame deletion in sigB, suggesting that sigma-B positively regulated its own synthesis, and deletions in the sigB promoter region showed that sequences identical to the sigma-B-dependent ctc promoter were essential for promoter activity. Fusion expression was greatly enhanced in a strain carrying an insertion mutation in orfX, suggesting that the 22-kilodalton (kDa) orfX product was a negative effector of sigma-B expression or activity. Notably, the genetic organization of the sigB operon was strikingly similar to that of the B. subtilis spoIIA operon, which has the gene order spoIIAA-spoIIAB-spoIIAC, with spoIIAC encoding the sporulation-essential sigma-F. The predicted sequence of the 12-kDa orfV product was 32\% identical to that of the 13-kDa SpoIIAA protein, and the 18-kDa orfW product was 27\% identical to the 16-kDa SpoIIAB protein. On the basis of this clear evolutionary conservation, we speculate these protein pairs regulate their respective sigma factors by a similar molecular mechanism and that the spoIIA and sigB operons might control divergent branches of stationary-phase gene expression.},

Bacillus subtilis encodes seven extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma (σ) factors that regulate functions important for survival under conditions eliciting cell envelope stress. Of these, four have been studied in detail: σM, σW, σX and σV. These four σ factors recognize overlapping sets of promoters, although the sequences that determine this overlapping recognition are incompletely understood. A major role in promoter selectivity has been ascribed to the core −10 and −35 promoter elements. Here, we demonstrate that a homopolymeric T-tract motif, proximal to the −35 element, functions in combination with the core promoter sequences to determine selectivity for ECF sigma factors. This motif is most critical for promoter activation by σV, and contributes variably to activation by σM, σX and σW. We propose that this motif, which is a feature of the deduced promoter consensus for a subset of ECF σ factors from many species, imparts intrinsic DNA curvature to influence promoter activity. The differential effect of this region among ECF σ factors thereby provides a mechanism to modulate the nature and extent of regulon overlap.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Promoter evolution by synthetic promoter library (SPL) is a powerful approach to development of functional synthetic promoters to synthetic biology. However, it requires much tedious and time-consuming screenings because of the plethora of different variants in SPL. Actually, a large proportion of mutants in the SPL are significantly lower in strength, which contributes only to fabrication of a promoter library with a continuum of strength. Thus, to effectively obtain the evolved synthetic promoter exhibiting higher strength, it is essential to develop novel strategies to construct mutant library targeting the pivotal region rather than the arbitrary region of the template promoter. In this study, a strategy termed stepwise evolution targeting the spacer of core promoter (SETarSCoP) was established in Bacillus subtilis to effectively evolve the strength of bacterial promoter.
RESULTS: The native promoter, PsrfA, from B. subtilis, which exhibits higher strength than the strong promoter P43, was set as the parental template. According to the comparison of conservation of the spacer sequences between - 35 box and - 10 box among a set of strong and weak native promoter, it revealed that 7-bp sequence immediately upstream of the - 10 box featured in the regulation of promoter strength. Based on the conservative feature, two rounds of consecutive evolution were performed targeting the hot region of PsrfA. In the first round, a primary promoter mutation library (pPML) was constructed by mutagenesis targeting the 3-bp sequence immediately upstream of the - 10 box of the PsrfA. Subsequently, four evolved mutants from pPML were selected to construction of four secondary promoter mutation libraries (sPMLs) based on mutagenesis of the 4-bp sequence upstream of the first-round target. After the consecutive two-step evolution, the mutant PBH4 was identified and verified to be a highly evolved synthetic promoter. The strength of PBH4 was higher than PsrfA by approximately 3 times. Moreover, PBH4 also exhibited broad suitability for different cargo proteins, such as β-glucuronidase and nattokinase. The proof-of-principle test showed that SETarSCoP successfully evolved both constitutive and inducible promoters.
CONCLUSION: Comparing with the commonly used SPL strategy, SETarSCoP facilitates the evolution process to obtain strength-evolved synthetic bacterial promoter through fabrication and screening of small-scale mutation libraries. This strategy will be a promising method to evolve diverse bacterial promoters to expand the toolbox for synthetic biology.},

In this study, we analysed the impact of the nucleotide composition between the SD sequence and the start codon (the spacer sequence) on the expression yield. We demonstrated that a polyadenylate-moiety spacer sequence moderately increases the expression level of laccase CotA from B. subtilis. By screening a library of artificially generated spacer variants, we identified clones with greatly increased expression levels of two model enzymes, the laccase CotA from B. subtilis (11 fold) and the metagenome derived protease H149 (30 fold). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of the spacer sequence is specific to the gene of interest. These results prove the high impact of the spacer sequence on the expression yield in B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {In vitro, the sigma(s) subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), RpoS, recognizes nearly identical -35 and -10 promoter consensus sequences as the vegetative sigma70. In vivo, promoter selectivity of RNAP holoenzyme containing either sigma(s) (Esigma(s)) or sigma70 (Esigma70) seems to be achieved by the differential ability of the two holoenzymes to tolerate deviations from the promoter consensus sequence. In this study, we suggest that many natural sigma(s)-dependent promoters possess a -35 element, a feature that has been considered as not conserved among sigma(s)-dependent promoters. These -35 hexamers are mostly non-optimally spaced from the -10 region, but nevertheless functional. A +/- 2 bp deviation from the optimal spacer length of 17 bp or the complete absence of a -35 consensus sequence decreases overall promoter activity, but at the same time favours Esigma(s) in its competition with Esigma70 for promoter recognition. On the other hand, the reduction of promoter activity due to shifting of the -35 element can be counterbalanced by an activity-stimulating feature such as A/T-richness of the spacer region without compromising Esigma(s) selectivity. Based on mutational analysis of sigma(s), we suggest a role of regions 2.5 and 4 of sigma(s) in sensing sub-optimally located -35 elements.},

	abstract = {Bacteria respond to diverse growth-limiting stresses by producing a large set of general stress proteins. In Bacillus subtilis and related Gram-positive pathogens, this response is governed by the sigma(B) transcription factor. To establish the range of cellular functions associated with the general stress response, we compared the transcriptional profiles of wild and mutant strains under conditions that induce sigma(B) activity. Macroarrays representing more than 3900 annotated reading frames of the B. subtilis genome were hybridized to (33)P-labelled cDNA populations derived from (i) wild-type and sigB mutant strains that had been subjected to ethanol stress; and (ii) a strain in which sigma(B) expression was controlled by an inducible promoter. On the basis of their significant sigma(B)-dependent expression in three independent experiments, we identified 127 genes as prime candidates for members of the sigma(B) regulon. Of these genes, 30 were known previously or inferred to be sigma(B) dependent by other means. To assist in the analysis of the 97 new genes, we constructed hidden Markov models (HMM) that identified possible sigma(B) recognition sequences preceding 21 of them. To test the HMM and to provide an independent validation of the hybridization experiments, we mapped the sigma(B)-dependent messages for seven representative genes. For all seven, the 5' end of the message lay near typical sigma(B) recognition sequences, and these had been predicted correctly by the HMM for five of the seven examples. Lastly, all 127 gene products were assigned to functional groups by considering their similarity to known proteins. Notably, products with a direct protective function were in the minority. Instead, the general stress response increased relative message levels for known or predicted regulatory proteins, for transporters controlling solute influx and efflux, including potential drug efflux pumps, and for products implicated in carbon metabolism, envelope function and macromolecular turnover.},

We showed that activation of the SigB-controlled general stress response by mild environmental or energy stress provided significant cross-protection to subsequent lethal oxidative, disulfide and nitrosative stress in Bacillus subtilis. SigB activation is mediated via the stressosome and RsbP, the main conduits of environmental and energy stress, respectively. Cells exposed to mild environmental stress while lacking the major stressosome components RsbT or RsbRA were highly sensitive to subsequent oxidative stress, whereas rsbRB, rsbRC, rsbRD, and ytvA null mutants showed a spectrum of sensitivity, confirming their redundant roles and suggesting they could modulate the signals generated by environmental or oxidative stress. By contrast, cells encountering stationary phase stress required RsbP but not RsbT to survive subsequent oxidative stress. Interestingly, optimum cross-protection against nitrosative stress caused by sodium nitropruside required SigB but not the known regulators, RsbT and RsbP, suggesting an additional and as yet uncharacterized route of SigB activation independent of the known regulators. Together, these results provide mechanistic information on how B. subtilis promotes enhanced resistance against lethal oxidative stress during mild environmental and energy stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Prokaryote genomes are the result of a dynamic flux of genes, with increases achieved via horizontal gene transfer and reductions occurring through gene loss. The ecological and selective forces that drive this genomic flexibility vary across species. Bacillus subtilis is a naturally competent bacterium that occupies various environments, including plant-associated, soil, and marine niches, and the gut of both invertebrates and vertebrates. Here, we quantify the genomic diversity of B. subtilis and infer the genome dynamics that explain the high genetic and phenotypic diversity observed. Phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses of 42 B. subtilis genomes uncover a remarkable genome diversity that translates into a core genome of 1,659 genes and an asymptotic pangenome growth rate of 57 new genes per new genome added. This diversity is due to a large proportion of low-frequency genes that are acquired from closely related species. We find no gene-loss bias among wild isolates, which explains why the cloud genome, 43\% of the species pangenome, represents only a small proportion of each genome. We show that B. subtilis can acquire xenologous copies of core genes that propagate laterally among strains within a niche. While not excluding the contributions of other mechanisms, our results strongly suggest a process of gene acquisition that is largely driven by competence, where the long-term maintenance of acquired genes depends on local and global fitness effects. This competence-driven genomic diversity provides B. subtilis with its generalist character, enabling it to occupy a wide range of ecological niches and cycle through them.},

RsbT is then free to interact with and activate RsbU, which in turn ultimately activates σB. In this study with purified proteins, we used mutant RsbR proteins to analyze the role of its phosphorylatable threonine residues. The results show that the phosphorylation of either of the two RsbT-phosphorylatable threonine residues (T171 and T205) in RsbR enhanced the kinase activity of RsbT towards RsbS. However, it appeared that RsbT preferentially phosphorylates T171. We also present in vitro evidence that identifies RsbX as a potential phosphatase for RsbR T205.},

Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against σB revealed that there was 20.1-fold activation of σB after a heat shock from 30 to 42°C. Osmotic upshock and ethanol exposure also upregulated σB, albeit less than a heat shock. When the intracellular ATP concentration was decreased by exposure to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), only limited increases in σB levels were observed, revealing that stress due to ATP depletion is not an important factor in σB activation in B. cereus. Analysis of transcription of the sigB operon by Northern blotting and primer extension revealed the presence of a σB-dependent promoter upstream of the first open reading frame (rsbV) of the sigB operon, indicating that transcription of sigB is autoregulated. A second σB-dependent promoter was identified upstream of the last open reading frame (orf4) of the sigB operon. Production of virulence factors and the nonhemolytic enterotoxin Nhe in a sigB null mutant was the same as in the parent strain. However, σB was found to play a role in the protective heat shock response of B. cereus. The sigB null mutant was less protected against the lethal temperature of 50°C by a preadaptation to 42°C than the parent strain was, resulting in a more-than-100-fold-reduced survival of the mutant after 40 min at 50°C.},

	abstract = {The general stress regulon of Bacillus subtilis is induced by activation of the σB transcription factor. σB activation occurs when one of two phosphatases responds to physical or nutritional stress to activate a positive σB regulator by dephosphorylation. The signal that triggers the nutritional stress phosphatase (RsbP) is unknown; however, RsbP activation occurs under culture conditions (glucose/phosphate starvation, azide or decoyinine treatment) that reduce the cell's levels of ATP and/or GTP. Variances in nucleotide levels in these instances may be coincidental rather than causal. RsbP carries a domain (PAS) that in some regulatory systems can respond directly to changes in electron transport, proton motive force, or redox potential, changes that typically precede shifts in high-energy nucleotide levels. The current work uses Bacillus subtilis with mutations in the oxidative phosphorylation and purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathways in conjunction with metabolic inhibitors to better define the inducing signal for RsbP activation. The data argue that a drop in ATP, rather than changes in GTP, proton motive force, or redox state, is the key to triggering σB activation.},

	abstract = {Growth-limiting stresses in bacteria induce the general stress response to protect the cells against future stresses. Energy stress caused by starvation conditions in Bacillus subtilis is transmitted to the σB transcription factor by stress-response regulators. RsbP, a positive regulator, is a phosphatase containing a PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) domain and requires catalytic function of a putative α/β hydrolase, RsbQ, to be activated. These two proteins have been found to interact with each other. We determined the crystal structures of RsbQ in native and inhibitor-bound forms to investigate why RsbP requires RsbQ. These structures confirm that RsbQ belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily. Since the catalytic triad is buried inside the molecule due to the closed conformation, the active site is constructed as a hydrophobic cavity that is nearly isolated from the solvent. This suggests that RsbQ has specificity for a hydrophobic small compound rather than a macromolecule such as RsbP. Moreover, structural comparison with other α/β hydrolases demonstrates that a unique loop region of RsbQ is a likely candidate for the interaction site with RsbP, and the interaction might be responsible for product release by operating the hydrophobic gate equipped between the cavity and the solvent. Our results support the possibility that RsbQ provides a cofactor molecule for the mature functionality of RsbP.},

The 1.8 MDa stressosome complex in Bacillus subtilis is a key signal transducer in the environmental stress response of the bacterium, its activation leading ultimately to the upregulation of over 150 genes. The single particle cryo-EM derived molecular envelope of the stressosome was used to generate a pseudo-atomic model by fitting the crystal structures of known components of the complex. The final structure comprises three separate proteins, RsbR, RsbS and RsbT in an unusual arrangement with a pseudo-icosahedral core with sensory extensions provided by the N-terminal domain of RsbR. Immuno-localization studies of the stressosome in fixed B. subtilis cells showed that the complexes are located as punctate foci in the cytoplasm and are stable throughout the imposition of stress. Furthermore, we investigated the response to a number of environmental stressors and found that the response elicited by the stressosome showed a cooperative effect. Taken together, these results imply that the stressosome acts to integrate stress signals from multiple sources, and offers a tunable and co-operative response to activating signals. Our findings, as well as their implications for bacterial signaling, are further discussed in this addendum.},

Reversible protein phosphorylation and the formation of alternative protein-protein complexes modulate the activity of σB, the RNA polymerase sigma factor subunit responsible for the transcription of the general stress response genes. Some of the regulators of σB, such as RsbR and RsbS, are known to associate in a 25S complex, called the stressosome, that can bind RsbT until RsbT phosphorylates target residues in RsbR and RsbS. To date, the RsbR-RsbS complex appears to be the most upstream component of the σB regulatory pathway. This large structure is thought to play an important role in sensing and/or integrating signals from different physical stresses. The roles of the paralogues of RsbR that are found in B. subtilis remain unclear. We describe here how the RsbR paralogues copurify with RsbR from B. subtilis cell lysates, and we demonstrate in vitro that the paralogues form large complexes either with RsbS or with a prepurified RsbR-RsbS binary complex. We conclude from these biochemical studies that stressosomes in B. subtilis cells contain minimally RsbS and all of the RsbT-phosphorylatable RsbR paralogues.},

These stresses include fluctuations in salt concentration, the presence of ethanol, changes in pH and even the level of UV light. Despite the obvious and significant differences between these quite different physicochemical stimuli, the result is the same: the stressosome is phosphorylated by a key kinase to initiate the sigma(B) cascade. The phosphorylation of the stressosome initiates a signal transduction system that up-regulates the expression of stress-responsive genes so that the Bacillus can survive the imposition of stress. Hence the stressosome acts as a hub, receiving manifold different stimuli to effect a single outcome. Using single-particle analysis of cryo-electron micrographs, we have been able to reconstruct a series of molecular envelopes of the stressosome. These maps have been interpreted at near-atomic resolution with crystal structures of the individual components of the stressosome to provide the first visualization of this unique signalling hub. The macromolecular structure adopted by the stressosome provides the signalling cascade with the potential for co-operative behaviour, which we have also measured in live bacteria. These experiments are consistent with the tuning of the response of B. subtilis to stress relative to the magnitude of the insult.},

RsbR and RsbS are organized in a 60-protomers truncated icosahedron. A key phosphorylation site on RsbR (T209) is partially hidden by an RsbR flexible loop, whose "open" or "closed" position could modulate stressosome activity. Interaction between three glutamic acids in the N-terminal domain of RsbR and the membrane-bound mini-protein Prli42 is essential for Listeria survival to stress. Together, our data provide the atomic model of the stressosome core and highlight a loop important for stressosome activation, paving the way towards elucidating the mechanism of signal transduction by the stressosome in bacteria.},

	abstract = {Bacteria possess protein serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases which resemble eukaryal kinases in their capacity to phosphorylate multiple substrates. We hypothesized that the analogy might extend further, and bacterial kinases may also undergo mutual phosphorylation and activation, which is currently considered as a hallmark of eukaryal kinase networks. In order to test this hypothesis, we explored the capacity of all members of four different classes of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases present in the firmicute model organism Bacillus subtilis to phosphorylate each other in vitro and interact with each other in vivo. The interactomics data suggested a high degree of connectivity among all types of kinases, while phosphorylation assays revealed equally wide-spread cross-phosphorylation events. Our findings suggest that the Hanks-type kinases PrkC, PrkD, and YabT exhibit the highest capacity to phosphorylate other B. subtilis kinases, while the BY-kinase PtkA and the two-component-like kinases RsbW and SpoIIAB show the highest propensity to be phosphorylated by other kinases. Analysis of phosphorylated residues on several selected recipient kinases suggests that most cross-phosphorylation events concern key regulatory residues. Therefore, cross-phosphorylation events are very likely to influence the capacity of recipient kinases to phosphorylate substrates downstream in the signal transduction cascade. We therefore conclude that bacterial serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases probably engage in a network-type behavior previously described only in eukaryal cells.},

On the basis of the results reported here, we propose that sigma B controls a general stress regulon that is induced when cells encounter a variety of growth-limiting conditions. Expression of genes controlled by sigma B, including the ctc gene and the sigB operon that codes for sigma B and its associated regulatory proteins, was dramatically induced in both the exponential and stationary phases by environmental challenges known to elicit a general stress response. After cells were subjected to salt stress, the increased expression of lacZ transcriptional fusions to the ctc and sigB genes was entirely dependent on sigma B, and primer extension experiments confirmed that the sigma B-dependent transcriptional start site was used during salt induction of sigB operon expression. Western blotting (immunoblotting) experiments measuring the levels of sigma B protein indicated that ethanol addition and heat stress also induced sigma B activity during logarithmic growth. Salt and ethanol induction during logarithmic growth required RsbV, the positive regulator of sigma B activity that is normally necessary for activity in stationary-phase cells. However, heat induction of sigma B activity was largely independent of RsbV, indicating that there are two distinct pathways by which these environmental signals are conveyed to the transcriptional apparatus.},

Little is known about the metabolic signals and protein factors regulating the activity of sigma B. The operon containing the sigma B structural gene has the gene order orfV-orfW-sigB-rsbX, and operon expression is autoregulated positively by sigma B and negatively by the rsbX product (rsbX = regulator of sigma B). To establish the roles of the orfV and orfW products, orfV and orfW null and missense mutations were constructed and tested for their effects on expression of the sigma B-dependent genes ctc and csbA. These mutations were tested in two contexts: in the first, the sigB operon was under control of its wild-type, sigma B-dependent promoter, and in the second, the sigB operon promoter was replaced by the inducible Pspac promoter. The principal findings are that (i) the orfV (now called rsbV) product is a positive regulator of sigma B-dependent gene expression; (ii) the orfW (now called rsbW) product is a negative regultor of such expression; (iii) sigma B is inactive during logarithmic growth unless the rsbW product is absent; (iv) the rsbX, rsbV, and rsbW products have a hierarchical order of action; and (v) both the rsbV and rsbW products appear to regulate sigma B activity posttranslationally. There are likely to be at least two routes by which information can enter the system to regulate sigma B: via the rsbX product, and via the rsbV and rsbW products.},

We establish the use of this approach by identifying, isolating, and characterizing a gene dependent on sigma B, an alternate transcription factor which is found early in stationary phase but which is not essential for sporulation. The method relies on two features: (i) a plate transformation technique to introduce a null mutation into the regulatory gene of interest and (ii) random transcriptional fusions to a reporter gene to monitor gene expression in the presence and absence of a functional regulatory product. We applied this genetic approach to isolate genes comprising the sigma B regulon. We screened a random Tn917lacZ library for fusions that required an intact sigma B structural gene (sigB) for greatest expression, converting the library strains from wild-type sigB+ to sigB delta::cat directly on plates selective for chloramphenicol resistance. We isolated one such fusion, csbA::Tn917lacZ (csb for controlled by sigma B), which mapped between hisA and degSU on the B. subtilis chromosome. We cloned the region surrounding the insertion, identified the csbA reading frame containing the transposon, and found that this frame encoded a predicted 76-residue product which was extremely hydrophobic and highly basic. Primer extension and promoter activity experiments identified a sigma B-dependent promoter 83 bp upstream of the csbA coding sequence. A weaker, tandem, sigma A-like promoter was likewise identified 28 bp upstream of csbA. The csbA fusion was maximally expressed during early stationary phase in cells grown in Luria broth containing 5\% glucose and 0.2\% glutamine. This timing of expression and medium dependence were very similar to those for ctc, the only other recognized gene dependent on sigma B.},

Dual channel imaging and warping of 2-D protein gels were used to visualize global changes in the protein synthesis pattern of cells in response to osmotic stress (6\% NaCl). Many vegetative enzymes were repressed in response to salt stress and derepressed after resumption of growth. The enzymes catalyzing the metabolic steps from glucose to 2-oxoglutarate, however, were almost constantly synthesized during salt stress despite the growth arrest. This indicates an enhanced need for the proline precursor glutamate. The synthesis of enzymes involved in sulfate assimilation and in the formation of Fe-S clusters was also induced, suggesting an enhanced need for the formation or repair of Fe-S clusters in response to salt stress. One of the most obvious changes in the protein synthesis profile can be followed by the very strong induction of the SigB regulon. Furthermore, members of the SigW regulon and of the PerR regulon, indicating oxidative stress after salt challenge, were also induced. This proteomic approach provides an overview of cell adaptation to an osmotic upshift in B. subtilis visualizing the most dramatic changes in the protein synthesis pattern.},

The large number of vegetative proteins identified by gel-based and gel-free approaches is a good starting point for comparative physiological investigations. For this reason a gel-free quantitation with the recently introduced iTRAQ (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation) reagent technique was performed to investigate the heat shock response in B. subtilis. A comparison with gel-based data showed that both techniques revealed a similar level of up-regulation for proteins belonging to well studied heat hock regulons (SigB, HrcA, and CtsR).

Most of the phosphate starvation-induced proteins are under the control of sigma(B), the activity of which is increased by energy depletion. In order to define the proteins belonging to the Pho regulon, which is regulated by the two-component regulatory proteins PhoP and PhoR, the 2D protein pattern of the wild type was compared with those of a sigB mutant and a phoR mutant. By matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, two alkaline phosphatases (APases) (PhoA and PhoB), an APase-alkaline phosphodiesterase (PhoD), a glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ), and the lipoprotein YdhF were identified as very strongly induced PhoPR-dependent proteins secreted into the extracellular medium. In the cytoplasmic fraction, PstB1, PstB2, and TuaD were identified as already known PhoPR-dependent proteins, in addition to PhoB, PhoD, and the previously described PstS. Transcriptional studies of glpQ and ydhF confirmed the strong PhoPR dependence. Northern hybridization and primer extension experiments showed that glpQ is transcribed monocistronically from a sigma(A) promoter which is overlapped by four putative TT(A/T)ACA-like PhoP binding sites. Furthermore, ydhF might be cotranscribed with phoB initiating from the phoB promoter. Only a small group of proteins remained phosphate starvation inducible in both phoR and sigB mutant and did not form a unique regulation group. Among these, YfhM and YjbC were controlled by sigma(B)-dependent and unknown PhoPR-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, YtxH and YvyD seemed to be induced after phosphate starvation in the wild type in a sigma(B)-dependent manner and in the sigB mutant probably via sigma(H). YxiE was induced by phosphate starvation independently of sigma(B) and PhoPR.},

Transcriptomic and proteomic approaches can provide a picture of the dynamic changes occurring in salt-stressed B. subtilis cultures because these studies provide an unbiased view of cells coping with high salinity. We applied whole-genome microarray technology and metabolic labeling, combined with state-of-the-art proteomic techniques, to provide a global and time-resolved picture of the physiological response of B. subtilis cells exposed to a severe and sudden osmotic upshift. This combined experimental approach provided quantitative data for 3,961 mRNA transcription profiles, 590 expression profiles of proteins detected in the cytosol, and 383 expression profiles of proteins detected in the membrane fraction. Our study uncovered a well-coordinated induction of gene expression subsequent to an osmotic upshift that involves large parts of the SigB, SigW, SigM, and SigX regulons. Additionally osmotic upregulation of a large number of genes that do not belong to these regulons was observed. In total, osmotic upregulation of about 500 B. subtilis genes was detected. Our data provide an unprecedented rich basis for further in-depth investigation of the physiological and genetic responses of B. subtilis to hyperosmotic stress.},

Taking advantage of the large number of known regulatory interactions in Bacillus subtilis and two transcriptomics datasets (including one with 38 separate experiments collected specifically for this study), we use a new combination of network component analysis and model selection to simultaneously estimate transcription factor activities and learn a substantially expanded transcriptional regulatory network for this bacterium. In total, we predict 2,258 novel regulatory interactions and recall 74\% of the previously known interactions.

	abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis stressosome is a 1.8 MDa complex that orchestrates activation of the σ(B) transcription factor by environmental stress. The complex comprises members of the RsbR co-antagonist family and the RsbS antagonist, which together form an icosahedral core that sequesters the RsbT serine-threonine kinase. Phosphorylation of this core by RsbT is associated with RsbT release, which activates downstream signalling. RsbRA, the prototype co-antagonist, is phosphorylated on T171 and T205 in vitro. In unstressed cells T171 is already phosphorylated; this is a prerequisite but not the trigger for activation, which correlates with stress-induced phosphorylation of RsbS on S59. In contrast, phosphorylation of RsbRA T205 has not been detected in vivo. Here we find (i) RsbRA is additionally phosphorylated on T205 following strong stresses, (ii) this modification requires RsbT, and (iii) the phosphorylation-deficient T205A substitution greatly increases post-stress activation of σ(B) . We infer that T205 phosphorylation constitutes a second feedback mechanism to limit σ(B) activation, operating in addition to the RsbX feedback phosphatase. Loss of RsbX function increases the fraction of phosphorylated RsbS and doubly phosphorylated RsbRA in unstressed cells. We propose that RsbX both maintains the ready state of the stressosome prior to stress and restores it post-stress.},

This is amplified by the paucity of information of power-spectra of physicochemical stimuli to which microorganisms are exposed. Future studies of genome evolution, driven by altered stimulus regimes, will therefore require a versatile signal transduction system that allows accurate signal dosing. Here, we review the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis, and its upstream signal transduction network, as a candidate system. It can be activated by red and blue light, and by many additional stimuli. Signal integration therefore is an intricate function of this system. The blue-light response is elicited via the photoreceptor YtvA, which forms an integral part of stressosomes, to activate expression of the stress regulon of B. subtilis. Signal transfer through this network can be assayed with reporter enzymes, while intermediate steps can be studied with live-cell imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins. Different parts of this system have been studied in vitro, such that its computational modeling has made significant progress. One can directly relate the microscopic characteristics of YtvA with activation of the general stress regulon, making this system a very well-suited system for network evolution studies.},

Here we present genetic evidence that a sixth paralog, YtvA, acts as a positive regulator in the same environmental signaling branch. We also present biochemical evidence that YtvA and at least three of the negative regulators can be isolated from cell extracts in a large environmental signaling complex. YtvA differs from these associated negative regulators by its flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-containing light-oxygen-voltage domain. Others have shown that this domain has the photochemistry expected for a blue-light sensor, with the covalent linkage of the FMN chromophore to cysteine 62 composing a critical part of the photocycle. Consistent with the view that light intensity modifies the output of the environmental signaling pathway, we found that cysteine 62 is required for YtvA to exert its positive regulatory role in the absence of other stress. Transcriptional analysis of the ytvA structural gene indicated that it provides the entry point for at least one additional environmental input, mediated by the Spx global regulator of disulfide stress. These results support a model in which the large signaling complex serves to integrate multiple environmental signals in order to modulate the general stress response.},

	abstract = {Activity of the general stress transcription factor sigma(B) of Bacillus subtilis is regulated directly by a partner-switching mechanism in which key protein interactions are governed by serine phosphorylation. Signals of energy or environmental stress are conveyed to sigma(B) by independent pathways, each terminating with a differentially regulated serine phosphatase, whose activity is required to control the partner-switching regulators. We present genetic and biochemical evidence that activation of the RsbU environmental signaling phosphatase is modulated by a second, atypical partner switch that comprises redundant negative regulatory proteins in a large, multicomponent signaling complex. In the current model, negative regulation of the RsbU phosphatase depends solely on the RsbS antagonist protein. Here, we perform a critical genetic test that invalidates this model and demonstrates that the RsbS antagonist alone is insufficient to prevent environmental signaling. Also required is one of a family of four co-antagonist proteins, here renamed RsbRA, RsbRB, RsbRC, and RsbRD, each with a carboxyl-terminal domain closely resembling the entire RsbS protein. Because any single member of the RsbR family, together with RsbS, was sufficient for environmental signaling, we conclude that the RsbR proteins serve as redundant co-antagonists necessary for RsbS antagonist function. Moreover, purification of RsbRA from cell extracts by nickel affinity and gel-filtration chromatography found a multicomponent complex containing the RsbRA and RsbRB co-antagonists together with the RsbS antagonist. We propose that this complex serves as a machine to transmit stress signals to sigma(B), and that the properties of the complex may contribute to environmental stress sensing.},

However, general stress responses coexist with more specific pathways that are activated by individual stresses, provoking the fundamental question of whether and how cells control the generality or specificity of their response to a particular stress. Here we address this issue using quantitative time-lapse microscopy of the Bacillus subtilis environmental stress response, mediated by σB. We analyzed σB activation in response to stresses such as salt and ethanol imposed at varying rates of increase. Dynamically, σB responded to these stresses with a single adaptive activity pulse, whose amplitude depended on the rate at which the stress increased. This rate-responsive behavior can be understood from mathematical modeling of a key negative feedback loop in the underlying regulatory circuit. Using RNAseq we analyzed the effects of both rapid and gradual increases of ethanol and salt stress across the genome. Because of the rate responsiveness of σB activation, salt and ethanol regulons overlap under rapid, but not gradual, increases in stress. Thus, the cell responds specifically to individual stresses that appear gradually, while using σB to broaden the cellular response under more rapidly deteriorating conditions. Such dynamic control of specificity could be a critical function of other general stress response pathways.},

The gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis responds to energy stress (ATP depletion) and to environmental stressors using two distinct stress-sensing pathways that converge on the alternative sigma factor σB to provoke a general stress response. Past efforts to study the σB stress response in bulk culture and on agarose pads were unable to visualize the responses of individual cells under tightly controlled conditions for extended periods of time. Here we use a microfluidics-based strategy to discern the basic features of σB activation in single cells in response to energy and environmental stress, both immediately upon stressor exposure and for tens of generations thereafter. Upon energy stress at various levels of stressor, cells exhibited fast, transient, and amplitude-modulated responses but not frequency modulation as previously reported. Upon environmental stress, which is mediated by the stressosome complex, wild-type cells primarily exhibited a transient and amplitude-modulated response. However, mutant cells producing only one of the four paralogous RsbR stressosome proteins showed striking and previously unseen differences. Whereas RsbRA-only cells mimicked the wild type, RsbRC-only cells displayed a slower but sustained overall response composed of repeated activation events in single cells.},

It is regulated by a dedicated σ factor via a complex signal transduction pathway that makes use of stressosomes: hetero-oligomeric complexes that include one or more of the RsbR proteins (RsbRA, RsbRB, RsbRC, and RsbRD). The response to blue light is mediated by the photoreceptor YtvA. We show here which of the four RsbR proteins are necessary for the activation of the σB response by blue light. Experiments performed with single-, double-, and triple-deletion strains in the rsbR genes show that RsbRB and RsbRA function antagonistically, with the former being a negative regulator and the latter a positive regulator of the YtvA-dependent light activation of the stress response. A strain with RsbRB as the only RsbR protein is unable to respond to light-activation of σB. Furthermore, RsbRC and RsbRD can replace RsbRA's function only in the absence of RsbRB. This differentiation of function is confined to light stress, since strains with RsbRA or RsbRB as the only RsbR protein behave similarly in our experimental conditions in response to physicochemical stresses. Interestingly, RsbRB's absence is sufficient to result in light activation of the general stress response at wild-type expression levels of ytvA, while it was previously reported that YtvA could only activate σB when overproduced, or when cells are supplemented with an additional environmental stress.},

In L. monocytogenes, 168 genes were positively regulated by σB; 145 of these genes were preceded by a putative σB consensus promoter. In L. innocua, 64 genes were positively regulated by σB. σB contributed to acid stress survival in log-phase cells for both species but to survival in stationary-phase cells only for L. monocytogenes. In summary, (i) the L. monocytogenes σB regulon includes {\textgreater}140 genes that are both directly and positively regulated by σB, including genes encoding proteins with importance in stress response, virulence, transcriptional regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and transport; (ii) a number of L. monocytogenes genes encoding flagellar proteins show higher transcript levels in the ΔsigB mutant, and both L. monocytogenes and L. innocua ΔsigB null mutants have increased motility compared to the respective isogenic parent strains, suggesting that σB affects motility and chemotaxis; and (iii) although L. monocytogenes and L. innocua differ in σB-dependent acid stress resistance and have species-specific σB-dependent genes, the L. monocytogenes and L. innocua σB regulons show considerable conservation, with a common set of at least 49 genes that are σB dependent in both species.},

FFP proved to be more effective in inferring the phylogeny of Bacillus than methods based on single gene sequences [16s rRNA gene, GryB (gyrase subunit B) and AroE (shikimate-5-dehydrogenase)] analyses. The findings of FFP analysis were verified using kSNP v2 (alignment-free sequence analysis method) and Harvest suite (core genome sequence alignment method).},

These strains were moderately thermophilic, neutrophilic, motile, spore-forming rods, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic. The G+C content of their DNA ranged from 49.7 to 52.3 mol\%. The major isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone-7; cellular fatty acid profiles consisted of significant amounts of iso-15:0, iso-16:0 and iso-17:0 fatty acids (61.7-86.8\% of the total). Based on data from 16S rDNA analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization, the subsurface isolates could be divided into two groups, one of which consisted of strains UT and X and the other of which consisted of strains K, Sam and 34T. The new strains exhibited a close phylogenetic relationship to thermophilic bacilli of 'Group 5' of Ash et al. [Ash, C., Farrow, J. A. E., Wallbanks, S. \& Collins, M. D. (1991). Lett Appl Microbiol 13, 202-206] and a set of corresponding signature positions of 16S rRNA. Comparative analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences and fatty acid compositions of the novel isolates and established species of thermophilic bacilli indicated that the subsurface strains represent two new species within a new genus, for which the names Geobacillus subterraneus gen. nov., sp. nov., and Geobacillus uzenensis sp. nov. are proposed. It is also proposed that Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus thermoleovorans, Bacillus thermocatenulatus, Bacillus kaustophilus, Bacillus thermoglucosidasius and Bacillus thermodenitrificans be transferred to this new genus, with Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus) as the type species.},

	abstract = {In the Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis glutamate is synthesized by the glutamine synthetase and the glutamate synthase (GOGAT). During growth with carbon sources that exert carbon catabolite repression, the rocG glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) gene is repressed and the transcription factor GltC activates the expression of the GOGAT encoding gltAB genes. In the presence of amino acids of the glutamate family, the GDH RocG is synthesized and the enzyme prevents GltC from binding to DNA. The dual control of glutamate biosynthesis allows the efficient utilization of the available nutrients. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that, like RocG, also the paralogous GDH GudB can inhibit the transcription factor GltC, thereby controlling glutamate biosynthesis. Contradictory previous observations show that high level of GDH activity does not result in permanent inhibition of GltC. By controlling the intracellular levels of glutamate through feeding with exogenous arginine, we observed that the GDH-dependent control of GltC and thus expression of the gltAB genes inversely correlates with the glutamate pool. These results suggest that the B. subtilis GDHs RocG and GudB in fact act as glutamate sensors. In conclusion, the GDH-mediated control of glutamate biosynthesis seems to depend on the intracellular glutamate concentration.},

	abstract = {The classic strategy to achieve gene deletion variants is based on double-crossover integration of nonreplicating vectors into the genome. In addition, recombination systems such as Cre-lox have been used extensively, mainly for eukaryotic organisms. This study presents the construction of a Cre-lox-based system for multiple gene deletions in Lactobacillus plantarum that could be adapted for use on gram-positive bacteria. First, an effective mutagenesis vector (pNZ5319) was constructed that allows direct cloning of blunt-end PCR products representing homologous recombination target regions. Using this mutagenesis vector, double-crossover gene replacement mutants could be readily selected based on their antibiotic resistance phenotype. In the resulting mutants, the target gene is replaced by a lox66-P32-cat-lox71 cassette, where lox66 and lox71 are mutant variants of loxP and P32-cat is a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The lox sites serve as recognition sites for the Cre enzyme, a protein that belongs to the integrase family of site-specific recombinases. Thus, transient Cre recombinase expression in double-crossover mutants leads to recombination of the lox66-P32-cat-lox71 cassette into a double-mutant loxP site, called lox72, which displays strongly reduced recognition by Cre. The effectiveness of the Cre-lox-based strategy for multiple gene deletions was demonstrated by construction of both single and double gene deletions at the melA and bsh1 loci on the chromosome of the gram-positive model organism Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Cre-lox-based system in multiple gene replacements was determined by successive mutagenesis of the genetically closely linked loci melA and lacS2 in L. plantarum WCFS1. The fact that 99.4\% of the clones that were analyzed had undergone correct Cre-lox resolution emphasizes the suitability of the system described here for multiple gene replacement and deletion strategies in a single genetic background.},

	abstract = {Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the most important form of vitamin B6 serves as a cofactor for many proteins. Two alternative pathways for de novo PLP biosynthesis are known: the short deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP)-independent pathway, which is present in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the longer DXP-dependent pathway, which has been intensively studied in the Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli. Previous studies revealed that bacteria contain many promiscuous enzymes causing a so-called 'underground metabolism', which can be important for the evolution of novel pathways. Here, we evaluated the potential of B. subtilis to use a truncated non-native DXP-dependent PLP pathway from E. coli for PLP synthesis. Adaptive laboratory evolution experiments revealed that two non-native enzymes catalysing the last steps of the DXP-dependent PLP pathway and two genomic alterations are sufficient to allow growth of vitamin B6 auxotrophic bacteria as rapid as the wild type. Thus, the existence of an underground metabolism in B. subtilis facilitates the generation of a pathway for synthesis of PLP using parts of a non-native vitamin B6 pathway. The introduction of non-native enzymes into a metabolic network and rewiring of native metabolism could be helpful to generate pathways that might be optimized for producing valuable substances.},

FapR is a transcription factor that negatively controls the expression of several genes of the fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis and was first identified in Bacillus subtilis. This review focuses on the genetic, biochemical and structural advances that led to a detailed understanding of lipid homeostasis control by FapR providing unique opportunities to learn how Gram-positive bacteria monitor the status of fatty acid biosynthesis and adjust the lipid synthesis accordingly.

	abstract = {The alternative transcription factor σB in Bacillus cereus governs the transcription of a number of genes that confer protection against general stress. This transcription factor is regulated by protein-protein interactions among RsbV, RsbW, σB, RsbY, RsbM and RsbK, all encoded in the sigB cluster. Among these regulatory proteins, RsbV, RsbW and σB comprise a partner-switching mechanism. Under normal conditions, σB remains inactive by associating with anti-sigma factor RsbW, which prevents σB from binding to the core RNA polymerase. During environmental stress, RsbK activates RsbY to hydrolyze phosphorylated RsbV, and the dephosphorylated RsbV then sequesters RsbW to liberate σB from RsbW. Although the σB partner-switching module is thought to be the core mechanism for σB regulation, the actual protein-protein interactions among these three proteins in the cell remain to be investigated. In the current study, we show that RsbW and RsbV form a long-lived complex under transient stress treatment, resulting in high persistent expression of RsbV, RsbW and σB from mid-log phase to stationary phase. Full sequestration of RsbW by excess RsbV and increased RsbW:RsbV complex stability afforded by cellular ADP contribute to the prolonged activation of σB. Interestingly, the high expression levels of RsbV, RsbW and σB were dramatically decreased beginning from the transition stage to the stationary phase. Thus, protein interactions among σB partner-switching components are required for the continued induction of σB during environmental stress in the log phase and significant down-regulation of σB is observed in the stationary phase. Our data show that σB is temporally regulated in B. cereus.},

	abstract = {σB, an alternative transcription factor, controls the response of the cell to a variety of environmental stresses in Bacillus cereus. Previously, we reported that RsbM negatively regulates σB through the methylation of RsbK, a hybrid sensor kinase, on a signaling helix (S-helix). However, RsbK comprises a C-terminal receiver (REC) domain whose function remains unclear. In this study, deletion of the C-terminal REC domain of RsbK resulted in high constitutive σB expression independent of environmental stimuli. Thus, the REC domain may serve as an inhibitory element. Mutagenic substitution was employed to modify the putative phospho-acceptor residue D827 in the REC domain of RsbK. The expression of RsbKD827N and RsbKD827E exhibited high constitutive σB, indicating that D827, if phosphorylatable, possibly participates in σB regulation. Bacterial two-hybrid analyses demonstrated that RsbK forms a homodimer and the REC domain interacts mainly with the histidine kinase (HK) domain and partly with the S-helix. In particular, co-expression of RsbM strengthens the interaction between the REC domain and the S-helix. Consistently, our structural model predicts a significant interaction between the HK and REC domains of the RsbK intradimer. Here, we demonstrated that coordinated the methylatable S-helix and the REC domain of RsbK is functionally required to modulate σB-mediated stress response in B. cereus and maybe ubiquitous in microorganisms encoded RsbK-type sensor kinases.},

	abstract = {The stress-responsive, alternative sigma factor sigmaB has been described in members of three Gram-positive genera, Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus. In these bacteria, sigmaB appears to play an important role in facilitating rapid adaptation to and survival in stressful environments. sigmaB activity is regulated through a complex system of phosphatases and kinases encoded by rsb (regulator of sigma B) genes. We describe the sigB operon structure for the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and apply this sequence as well as other previously described sigB operon sequences to probe the evolution and functional conservation of the sigmaB stress response system among different Gram-positive bacteria. While sigmaB as well as two Rsbs (RsbS and RsbT) are highly conserved (73\%, 84\%, and 79\% average amino acid [aa] identities, respectively), the predicted aa sequences of the other Rsb proteins showed less conservation (62-71\% aa identities). Furthermore, the sigB operon structure varies among bacterial species. Bacterial species differ in the numbers and identities of rsb genes encoded in their genomes. We thus conclude that the sigmaB stress-response system as represented by the sigB operon has diverged in both its overall components as well as in the sequences of its individual proteins, even among closely related bacterial species.

	abstract = {The alternative sigma factor σB of the food pathogen Bacillus cereus is activated upon stress exposure and plays a role in the adaptive response of vegetative cells. This study describes the identification of σB-dependent genes in B. cereus. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed with protein extracts from a σB-overproducing B. cereus strain. Nine protein spots, which were absent from the negative control, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry or N-terminal sequencing. The σB-dependent expression of the corresponding genes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis with RNA isolated from B. cereus ATCC 14579 and its sigB null mutant. Northern blot analysis also revealed that six other genes were part of σB-dependent operons. The proteins that are predicted to be encoded by the σB-dependent genes include an intracellular protease, a Mg2+ transporter, and a thiamine biosynthesis protein (ThiG). Highly conserved promoter sites were found to precede all σB-dependent genes, with the exception of thiG. By searching the B. cereus genome for this conserved promoter sequence, five more candidate σB-dependent genes were identified. Northern blot analysis and in vitro transcription experiments with a reconstituted B. cereus σB-RNA polymerase holoenzyme confirmed the σB dependency of two of these genes and strongly suggested that two other genes, encoding an oligopeptide-binding OppA-like protein and subunit II of the cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase, are also σB dependent. In conclusion, σB of B. cereus not only regulates genes directly involved in the stress response but may also control specific metabolic rearrangements.},

Here, we report a genome-wide N-terminomic approach in Listeria that strikingly led to the discovery of 19 internal translation initiation sites and 6 miniproteins, among which one, Prli42, is conserved in Firmicutes. Prli42 is membrane-anchored and interacts with orthologues of Bacillus stressosome components. We reconstituted the Listeria stressosome in vitro and visualized its supramolecular structure by electron microscopy. Analysis of a series of Prli42 mutants demonstrated that Prli42 is important for sigma B activation, bacterial growth following oxidative stress and for survival in macrophages. Taken together, our N-terminonic approach unveiled Prli42 as a long-sought link between stress and the stressosome.},

	abstract = {The alternative transcription factor σB of Bacillus cereus controls the expression of a number of genes that respond to environmental stress. Four proteins encoded in the sigB gene cluster, including RsbV, RsbW, RsbY (RsbU) and RsbK, are known to be essential in the σB-mediated stress response. In the context of stress, the hybrid sensor kinase RsbK is thought to phosphorylate the response regulator RsbY, a PP2C serine phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated RsbV. The unphosphorylated RsbV then sequesters the σB antagonist, RsbW, ultimately liberating σB. The gene arrangement reveals an open reading frame, bc1007, flanked immediately downstream by rsbK within the sigB gene cluster. However, little is known about the function of bc1007. In this study, the deletion of bc1007 resulted in high constitutive σB expression independent of environmental stimuli, indicating that bc1007 plays a role in σB regulation. A bacterial two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that BC1007 interacts directly with RsbK, and autoradiographic studies revealed a specific C14-methyl transfer from the radiolabelled S-adenosylmethionine to RsbK when RsbK was incubated with purified BC1007. Our data suggest that BC1007 (RsbM) negatively regulates σB activity by methylating RsbK. Additionally, mutagenic substitution was employed to modify 12 predicted methylation residues in RsbK. Certain RsbK mutants were able to rescue σB activation in a rsbK-deleted bacterial strain, but RsbKE439A failed to activate σB, and RsbKE446A only moderately induced σB. These results suggest that Glu439 is the preferred methylation site and that Glu446 is potentially a minor methylation site. Gene arrays of the rsbK orthologues and the neighbouring rsbM orthologues are found in a wide range of bacteria. The regulation of sigma factors through metylation of RsbK-like sensor kinases appears to be widespread in the microbial world.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of Staphylococcus aureus transposon insertion mutants showing decreased methicillin or teicoplanin resistance have suggested a role for the RNA polymerase alternative sigma factor SigB in the expression of resistance to these antibiotics. A knockout mutation was created in the S. aureus strain COL sigB gene and its influence on oxacillin and vancomycin resistance was studied in a variety of parental backgrounds. Typically, sigB mutants of methicillin-resistant strains had oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) one-half of their parent strains. The effect of the sigB mutation appeared to be more dramatic when assessed by population analysis profiles or by growth in liquid culture in shaking flasks than by MIC determinations. Oxacillin MICs of COL and the COLDeltasigB mutant were 400 and 200 mg/l, respectively, by conventional determination and 800 and 100-200 mg/l from population analysis profiles. The COLDeltasigB mutant strain was significantly more inhibited by a range of oxacillin concentrations in a shake flask culture than strain COL. Mutation of sigB caused a decrease in vancomycin resistance in two laboratory derived glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus strains. The results suggest that some protein products whose expression is controlled by SigB play a role in resistance to cell wall-active antibiotics.},

	abstract = {The ability of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to survive antimicrobial treatments is a public health concern; therefore, this study was designed to investigate genetic mechanisms contributing to antimicrobial response in L. monocytogenes. In previous studies, the putative bacteriocin immunity gene lmo2570 was predicted to be regulated by the stress responsive alternative sigma factor, sigma(B). As the alternative sigma factor sigma(L) controls expression of genes important for resistance to some antimicrobial peptides, we hypothesized roles for lmo2570, sigma(B), and sigma(L) in L. monocytogenes antimicrobial response. Results from phenotypic characterization of a L. monocytogenes lmo2570 null mutant suggested that this gene does not contribute to resistance to nisin or to SdpC, an antimicrobial peptide produced by some strains of Bacillus subtilis. While lmo2570 transcript levels were confirmed to be sigma(B) dependent, they were sigma(L) independent and were not affected by the presence of nisin under the conditions used in this study. In spot-on-lawn assays with the SdpC-producing B. subtilis EG351, the L. monocytogenes DeltasigB, DeltasigL, and DeltasigB/DeltasigL strains all showed increased sensitivity to SdpC, indicating that both sigma(B) and sigma(L) regulate genes contributing to SdpC resistance. Nisin survival assays showed that sigma(B) and sigma(L) both affect L. monocytogenes sensitivity to nisin in broth survival assays; that is, a sigB null mutant is more resistant than the parent strain to nisin, while a sigB null mutation in DeltasigL background leads to reduced nisin resistance. In summary, while the sigma(B)-dependent lmo2570 does not contribute to resistance of L. monocytogenes to nisin or SdpC, both sigma(B) and sigma(L) contribute to the L. monocytogenes antimicrobial response.},

	abstract = {Low concentrations of the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampin added to an exponentially growing culture of Bacillus subtilis led to an instant inhibition of growth. Survival experiments revealed that during the growth arrest the cells became tolerant to the antibiotic and the culture was able to resume growth some time after rifampin treatment. L-[(35)S]methionine pulse-labeled protein extracts were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to investigate the change in the protein synthesis pattern in response to rifampin. The sigma(B)-dependent general stress proteins were found to be induced after treatment with the antibiotic. Part of the oxidative stress signature was induced as indicated by the catalase KatA and MrgA. The target protein of rifampin, the beta subunit (RpoB) of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the flagellin protein Hag belonging to the sigma(D) regulon were also induced. The rifampin-triggered growth arrest was extended in a sigB mutant in comparison to the wild-type strain, and the higher the concentration, the more pronounced this effect was. Activity of the RsbP energy-signaling phosphatase in the sigma(B) signal transduction network was also important for this protection against rifampin, but the RsbU environmental signaling phosphatase was not required. The sigB mutant strain was less capable of growing on rifampin-containing agar plates. When plated from a culture that had already reached stationary phase without previous exposure to the antibiotic during growth, the survival rate of the wild type exceeded that of the sigB mutant by a factor of 100. We conclude that the general stress response of B. subtilis is induced by rifampin depending on RsbP activity and that loss of SigB function causes increased sensitivity to the antibiotic.},

	abstract = {The alkaline shock protein Asp23 was identified as a sigmaB-dependent protein in Staphylococcus aureus. In Bacillus subtilis, the asp23 promoter from S. aureus is regulated like other sigmaB-dependent promoters, which are strongly induced by heat and ethanol stress. However, almost no induction of asp23 expression was found after heat or ethanol stress in S. aureus MA13 grown in a synthetic medium, where the basal expression level of asp23 is high. Under the same experimental conditions the sigmaB gene itself showed a similar expression pattern: it was highly expressed in synthetic medium but not induced by heat or ethanol stress. In contrast, sigmaB activity was increased by heat stress when the cells were grown in a complex medium. The constitutive expression of sigB and sigmaB-dependent stress genes in S. aureus MA13 grown in a synthetic medium is in a sharp contrast to the regulation of sigmaB activity in B. subtilis, and needs further investigation. A deletion of 11 bp in the rsbU gene, which encodes the phosphatase that acts on RsbV (the anti-anti-sigma factor), in S. aureus NCTC 8325-4 might be responsible for the failure of heat stress to activate sigmaB in complex medium, and thus reduce the initiation of transcription at sigmaB-dependent promoters in this strain.},

The phosphatase Spo0E specifically inactivates the response regulator Spo0A∼P by dephosphorylation. We identified a σB-type promoter adjacent to spo0E that is activated by the general stress response sigma factor σB and is responsible for spo0E induction in vivo. Ectopic expression of σB and subsequent induction of spo0E cause a σB-dependent block of sporulation-specific transcription of the spo0A and spoIIE genes and produces a sporulation-deficient phenotype. This effect could be erased by a deletion of the σB promoter of spo0E and thus solely addresses σB activity. Here, a molecular mechanism is shown that integrates σB activity into the decision-making process of sporulation and provides a link to interconnect these two dominant and probably mutually exclusive adaptive responses in the regulatory network of B. subtilis.},

Quantitative real-time PCR and promoter reporter studies showed that sigB is activated in static and continuous-flow biofilms.

WVs were unable to form biofilms, and exhibited increased proteolysis and haemolysis; all phenotypes attributable to loss-of-function mutations identified in the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor, sigB. For LPVs, no differences in biofilm forming capacity or proteolysis were observed compared with the parental strain. Genetic analysis of LPVs revealed that they had undergone mutation in the accessory gene regulator system (agrA), and deficiency in agr was confirmed by demonstrating loss of both colony spreading and haemolytic activity.

We showed that under laboratory conditions a strain deleted for sigB was unable to form a floating pellicle on the surface of a liquid medium. However, overexpression of yxaB, encoding a putative exopolysaccharide synthase, from a p(Spac) promoter in a sigB-deleted strain resulted in partial recovery of the wild-type phenotype, indicating the participation of the YxaB protein in this multicellular process. We present data concerning the regulation of transcription of genes yxaB and yxaA, encoding a putative glycerate kinase. Both genes are cotranscribed as a single transcription unit from a sigma(A)-dependent promoter during vegetative growth of a liquid bacterial culture. The promoter driving transcription of the yxaAB operon is regulated by AbrB. In addition, the second gene in the operon, yxaB, possesses its own promoter, which is recognized by RNA polymerase containing the sigma(B) subunit. This transcription start site is used under general stress conditions, resulting in increased expression.},

The ΔP4inlA strain, which has a deletion in the σB-dependent P4inlA promoter, and the ΔsigB strain had significantly reduced invasion efficiencies relative to that of the wild-type strain in the Caco-2 human colorectal epithelial cell line, while the invasion efficiency of a strain bearing a deletion in the partially σB dependent P2prfA promoter region did not differ from that of the wild type. The virulence of the ΔsigB and ΔP4inlA strains was attenuated in intragastrically inoculated guinea pigs, with the ΔsigB strain showing greater attenuation, while the virulence capacity of the ΔP2prfA strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain, suggesting that attenuation of virulence due to the ΔsigB mutation does not result from loss of σB-dependent prfA transcription. Our results show that σB-dependent activation of inlA is important for cell invasion and gastrointestinal infection and suggest that σB-regulated genes in addition to inlA appear to contribute to gastrointestinal infection. Interestingly, the virulence of the ΔsigB strain was not attenuated in intravenously infected guinea pigs. We conclude that (i) L. monocytogenes σB plays a critical role in invasion of human host cells, (ii) σB-mediated contributions to invasion are, in part, due to direct effects on inlA transcription but not on prfA transcription, and (iii) σB plays a critical role during the gastrointestinal stage of listeriosis in the guinea pig but is not important for systemic spread of the organism.},

 the stress-responsive alternative sigma factor σB
 has been identified in different species of Bacillus,
 Listeria, and Staphylococcus, the
 σB regulon has been extensively characterized only
 in B. subtilis. We combined biocomputing and microarray-based
 strategies to identify σB-dependent genes in the
 facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.
 Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based searches identified 170 candidate
 σB-dependent promoter sequences in the strain EGD-e
 genome sequence. These data were used to develop a specialized,
 208-gene microarray, which included 166 genes downstream of
 HMM-predicted σB-dependent promoters as well as
 selected virulence and stress response genes. RNA for the microarray
 experiments was isolated from both wild-type and ΔsigB
 null mutant L. monocytogenes cells grown to stationary phase
 or exposed to osmotic stress (0.5 M KCl). Microarray analyses
 identified a total of 55 genes with statistically significant
 σB-dependent expression under the conditions used in
 these experiments, with at least 1.5-fold-higher expression in the wild
 type over the sigB mutant under either stress condition (51
 genes showed at least 2.0-fold-higher expression in the wild type). Of
 the 55 genes exhibiting σB-dependent expression, 54
 were preceded by a sequence resembling the σB
 promoter consensus sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was
 used to confirm the σB-dependent nature of a subset
 of eight selected promoter regions. Notably, the
 σB-dependent L. monocytogenes genes
 identified through this HMM/microarray strategy included both stress
 response genes (e.g., gadB, ctc, and the glutathione
 reductase gene lmo1433) and virulence genes (e.g.,
 inlA, inlB, and bsh). Our data demonstrate
 that, in addition to regulating expression of genes important for
 survival under environmental stress conditions, σB
 also contributes to regulation of virulence gene expression in L.
 monocytogenes. These findings strongly suggest that
 σB contributes to L. monocytogenes gene
 expression during
 infection.},

Recent findings indicate that σB also plays an important role in antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis and cellular differentiation processes such as biofilm formation and sporulation. Although there are important differences in the regulation of σB and in the set of genes regulated by σB in B. subtilis, B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, there are also some conserved themes.

RsbP has a predicted N-terminal Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, a central coiled-coil, and a C-terminal protein phosphatase M (PPM) domain. Previous studies support a model in which RsbQ provides an activity needed for PAS to regulate the phosphatase domain via the coiled-coil. RsbQ and the PAS domain (RsbP-PAS) therefore appear to form a sensory module. Here we test this hypothesis using bioinformatic and genetic analysis. We found 45 RsbQ and RsbP-PAS homologues encoded by adjacent genes in diverse bacteria, with PAS and a predicted coiled-coil fused to one of three output domains: PPM phosphatase (Gram positive bacteria), histidine protein kinase (Gram negative bacteria), and diguanylate cyclase (both lineages). Multiple alignment of the RsbP-PAS homologues suggested nine residues that distinguish the class. Alanine substitutions at four of these conferred a null phenotype in B. subtilis, indicating their functional importance. The F55A null substitution lay in the Fα helix of an RsbP-PAS model. F55A inhibited interaction of RsbP with RsbQ in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays but did not significantly affect interaction of RsbP with itself. We propose that RsbQ directly contacts the PAS domains of an RsbP oligomer to provide the activating signal, which is propagated to the phosphatase domains via the coiled-coil. A similar mechanism would allow the RsbQ-PAS module to convey a common input signal to structurally diverse output domains, controlling a variety of physiological responses.},

An incubation test at 55 °C for 7 days, then validation of biological stability, is used as an indicator of compliance with good manufacturing practices. We propose a microbial risk assessment model predicting the percentage of non-stability due to G. stearothermophilus in canned green beans manufactured by a French company. The model accounts for initial microbial contaminations of fresh unprocessed green beans with G. stearothermophilus, cross-contaminations in the processing chain, inactivation processes and probability of survival and growth. The sterilization process is modeled by an equivalent heating time depending on sterilization value F₀ and on G. stearothermophilus resistance parameter z(T). Following the recommendations of international organizations, second order Monte-Carlo simulations are used, separately propagating uncertainty and variability on parameters. As a result of the model, the mean predicted non-stability rate is of 0.5\%, with a 95\% uncertainty interval of [0.1\%; 1.2\%], which is highly similar to data communicated by the French industry. A sensitivity analysis based on Sobol indices and some scenario tests underline the importance of cross-contamination at the blanching step, in addition to inactivation due to the sterilization process.},

In this study the response of B. pumilus to oxidative stress was investigated during a treatment with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide at the proteome, transcriptome and metabolome level. Genes/proteins belonging to regulons, which are known to have important functions in the oxidative stress response of other organisms, were found to be upregulated, such as the Fur, Spx, SOS or CtsR regulon. Strikingly, parts of the fundamental PerR regulon responding to peroxide stress in B. subtilis are not encoded in the B. pumilus genome. Thus, B. pumilus misses the catalase KatA, the DNA-protection protein MrgA or the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpCF. Data of this study suggests that the catalase KatX2 takes over the function of the missing KatA in the oxidative stress response of B. pumilus. The genome-wide expression analysis revealed an induction of bacillithiol (Cys-GlcN-malate, BSH) relevant genes. An analysis of the intracellular metabolites detected high intracellular levels of this protective metabolite, which indicates the importance of bacillithiol in the peroxide stress resistance of B. pumilus.},

H2O2 is a possible sterilant for spacecraft hardware because it is a low-temperature process and compatible with various modern-day spacecraft materials, electronics, and components. Both conventional biochemical testing and molecular analyses identified these strains as Bacillus pumilus. This Bacillus species was found in both unclassified (entrance floors, anteroom, and air-lock) and classified (floors, cabinet tops, and air) locations. Both vegetative cells and spores of several B. pumilus isolates were exposed to 5\% liquid H2O2 for 60 min. Spores of each strain exhibited higher resistance than their respective vegetative cells to liquid H2O2. Results indicate that the H2O2 resistance observed in both vegetative cells and spores is strain-specific, as certain B. pumilus strains were two to three times more resistant than a standard Bacillus subtilis dosimetry strain. An example of this trend was observed when the type strain of B. pumilus, ATCC 7061, proved sensitive, whereas several environmental strains exhibited varying degrees of resistance, to H2O2. Repeated isolation of H2O2-resistant strains of B. pumilus in a clean-room is a concern because their persistence might potentially compromise life-detection missions, which have very strict cleanliness and sterility requirements for spacecraft hardware.},

	abstract = {Glutamate is a central metabolite in all organisms since it provides the link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In Bacillus subtilis, glutamate is synthesized exclusively by the glutamate synthase, and it can be degraded by the glutamate dehydrogenase. In B. subtilis, the major glutamate dehydrogenase RocG is expressed only in the presence of arginine, and the bacteria are unable to utilize glutamate as the only carbon source. In addition to rocG, a second cryptic gene (gudB) encodes an inactive glutamate dehydrogenase. Mutations in rocG result in the rapid accumulation of gudB1 suppressor mutations that code for an active enzyme. In this work, we analyzed the physiological significance of this constellation of genes and enzymes involved in glutamate metabolism. We found that the weak expression of rocG in the absence of the inducer arginine is limiting for glutamate utilization. Moreover, we addressed the potential ability of the active glutamate dehydrogenases of B. subtilis to synthesize glutamate. Both RocG and GudB1 were unable to catalyze the anabolic reaction, most probably because of their very high Km values for ammonium. In contrast, the Escherichia coli glutamate dehydrogenase is able to produce glutamate even in the background of a B. subtilis cell. B. subtilis responds to any mutation that interferes with glutamate metabolism with the rapid accumulation of extragenic or intragenic suppressor mutations, bringing the glutamate supply into balance. Similarly, with the presence of a cryptic gene, the system can flexibly respond to changes in the external glutamate supply by the selection of mutations.},

After a short incubation in ice, a mixture of chemically competent bacteria and DNA is placed at 42°C for 45 seconds (heat shock) and then placed back in ice.  SOC media is added and the transformed cells are incubated at 37°C for 30 min with agitation. To be assured of isolating colonies irrespective of transformation efficiency, two quantities of transformed bacteria are plated. This traditional protocol can be used successfully to transform most commercially available competent bacteria. The turbocells from Genlantis can also be used in a novel 3-minute transformation protocol, described in the instruction manual.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0016151},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a number of gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria, the general stress response is regulated by the alternative sigma factor B (SigB). Common stressors which lead to the activation of SigB and the SigB-dependent regulon are high osmolarity, acid and several more. Recently is has been shown that also blue and red light activates SigB in Bacillus subtilis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By qRT-PCR we analyzed the transcriptional response of the pathogen L. monocytogenes to blue and red light in wild type bacteria and in isogenic deletion mutants for the putative blue-light receptor Lmo0799 and the stress sigma factor SigB. It was found that both blue (455 nm) and red (625 nm) light induced the transcription of sigB and SigB-dependent genes, this induction was completely abolished in the SigB mutant. The blue-light effect was largely dependent on Lmo0799, proving that this protein is a genuine blue-light receptor. The deletion of lmo0799 enhanced the red-light effect, the underlying mechanism as well as that of SigB activation by red light remains unknown. Blue light led to an increased transcription of the internalin A/B genes and of bacterial invasiveness for Caco-2 enterocytes. Exposure to blue light also strongly inhibited swimming motility of the bacteria in a Lmo0799- and SigB-dependent manner, red light had no effect there.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data established that visible, in particular blue light is an important environmental signal with an impact on gene expression and physiology of the non-phototrophic bacterium L. monocytogenes. In natural environments these effects will result in sometimes random but potentially also cyclic fluctuations of gene activity, depending on the light conditions prevailing in the respective habitat.},

	abstract = {The stressosome is a multi-protein signal integration and transduction hub found in a wide range of bacterial species. The role that the stressosome plays in regulating the transcription of genes involved in the general stress response has been studied most extensively in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The stressosome receives and relays the signal(s) that initiate a complex phosphorylation-dependent partner switching cascade, resulting in the activation of the alternative sigma factor σB. This sigma factor controls transcription of more than 150 genes involved in the general stress response. X-ray crystal structures of individual components of the stressosome and single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions of stressosome complexes, coupled with biochemical and single cell analyses, have permitted a detailed understanding of the dynamic signalling behaviour that arises from this multi-protein complex. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses indicate that genetic modules encoding key stressosome proteins are found in a wide range of bacterial species, indicating an evolutionary advantage afforded by stressosome complexes. Interestingly, the genetic modules are associated with a variety of signalling modules encoding secondary messenger regulation systems, as well as classical two-component signal transduction systems, suggesting a diversification in function. In this chapter we review the current research into stressosome systems and discuss the functional implications of the unique structure of these signalling complexes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surfactants are an important category of additives that are used widely in most of the formulations as solubilizers, stabilizers, and emulsifiers. Current drug delivery systems comprise of numerous synthetic surfactants (such as Cremophor EL, polysorbate 80, Transcutol-P), which are associated with several side effects though used in many formulations. Therefore, to attenuate the problems associated with conventional surfactants, a new generation of surface-active agents is obtained from the metabolites of fungi, yeast, and bacteria, which are termed as biosurfactants.
OBJECTIVES: In this article, we critically analyze the different types of biosurfactants, their origin along with their chemical and physical properties, advantages, drawbacks, regulatory status, and detailed pharmaceutical applications.
METHODS: 243 papers were reviewed and included in this review.
RESULTS: Briefly, Biosurfactants are classified as glycolipids, rhamnolipids, sophorolipids, trehalolipids, surfactin, lipopeptides \& lipoproteins, lichenysin, fatty acids, phospholipids, and polymeric biosurfactants. These are amphiphilic biomolecules with lipophilic and hydrophilic ends and are used as drug delivery vehicles (foaming, solubilizer, detergent, and emulsifier) in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite additives, they have some biological activity as well (anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-microbial, P-gp inhibition, etc.). These biomolecules possess better safety profiles and are biocompatible, biodegradable, and specific at different temperatures.
CONCLUSION: Biosurfactants exhibit good biomedicine and additive properties that can be used in developing novel drug delivery systems. However, more research should be driven due to the lack of comprehensive toxicity testing and high production cost which limits their use.},

In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure.},

Here, we describe the identification of the set of σB-regulated genes in B. cereus by DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptome upon a mild heat shock. Twenty-four genes could be identified as being σB dependent as witnessed by (i) significantly lower expression levels of these genes in mutants with a deletion of sigB and rsbY (which encode the alternative sigma factor σB and a crucial positive regulator of σB activity, respectively) than in the parental strain B. cereus ATCC 14579 and (ii) increased expression of these genes upon a heat shock. Newly identified σB-dependent genes in B. cereus include a histidine kinase and two genes that have predicted functions in spore germination. This study shows that the σB regulon of B. cereus is considerably smaller than that of other gram-positive bacteria. This appears to be in line with phylogenetic analyses where σB of the B. cereus group was placed close to the ancestral form of σB in gram-positive bacteria. The data described in this study and previous studies in which the complete σB regulon of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined enabled a comparison of the sets of σB-regulated genes in the different gram-positive bacteria. This showed that only three genes (rsbV, rsbW, and sigB) are conserved in their σB dependency in all four bacteria, suggesting that the σB regulon of the different gram-positive bacteria has evolved to perform niche-specific functions.},

Lichenysin A itself did not enhance the degradation activity of chosen microorganism-degraders and in most cases inhibited their PCB mineralization rates. Glucolipid surfactant from marine bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis showed in several tests a strong enhancing effect on microbial metabolization of Aroclor 1248 congeners. Biosurfactants appeared to act very specifically, i.e. depending on strain and concentration used. Experiments set up with soil samples did not give a clear answer whether bioemulsifiers applied at low concentration could sufficiently increase the rates of biodegradation in situ. Only A. borkumiensis glucose lipid caused the most marked enhancement of Aroclor 1248 metabolization in soil microcosm.

According to the therapeutic index, the C3(CA)2:Lichenysin mixture was the formulation least toxic to eukaryotic cells. Partial neutralization of C3(CA)2 by Lichenysin modified the mode of action that enhances the transition of bacterial cells into a viable but nonculturable state (VBNC) and improved the cell selectivity.},

Lactobacilli are facultative anaerobes forming a critical line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms, including those forming biofilms, such as Candida spp. This study aimed to investigate the anti-adhesion capabilities of vaginal Lactobacillus isolates against biofilms formed by pathogenic Candida species. When the extracellular biosurfactant activities of culture supernatants from 120 Lactobacillus isolates were evaluated by the oil-spreading method, clear spreading zones were recognized. Biofilm formation was quantified by the crystal violet plate assay, and different isolates exhibited anti-adhesion activity that ranged from 65.6to 74.4\% inhibition against Candida spp. biofilms. Liquid chromatography high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-HRESIMS) identified biosurfactants, extracted from three representative Lactobacillus isolates, as surfactin, iturin and lichenysin. Finally, the distribution of representative genes from six different biosynthetic clusters, related to the production of different biosurfactants, was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, surfactin, iturin and lichenysin were identified for the first time in vaginal Lactobacillus spp. These biosurfactants, which showed strong anti-adherence activity may be used as promising antibiofilm agents in equipment care to prevent vaginal infections by pathogenic Candida spp. with the prospect of reducing nosocomial infections.},

Currently, large-scale production is limited due to the low yield. This study found that lichenysin production was repressed by supplementation of extracellular amino acids. The global transcriptional factor CodY was hypothesized to prevent lichenysin biosynthesis under an amino acid-rich condition in Bacillus licheniformis. Thus, the codY null strain was constructed, and lichenysin production was increased by 31.0\% to 2356 mg/L with the addition of precursor amino acids, and the lichenysin production efficiency was improved by 42.8\% to 98.2 mg/L• h. Correspondingly, the transcription levels of the lichenysin synthetase gene lchAA, and its corresponding regulator genes comA, degQ, and degU, were upregulated. Also, the codY deletion enhanced biosynthesis of lichenysin precursor amino acids (Gln, Ile, Leu, and Val) and reduced the formation of byproducts, acetate, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol. This study firstly reported that lichenysin biosynthesis was negatively regulated by CodY and lichenysin production could be further improved with the precursor amino acid amendment in the codY null strain.},

Four different isoforms were identified in the protonated form [M+H]+ with m/z of 1030.6350, 1044.6511, 1058.6661 and 1072.6848. They were constituted of fatty acids varying from C13 to C16; however, about 70\% of the isoforms showed m/z of 1058.6661 and the fatty acid C15. Based on the AB2.0 genome sequence, only one gene group related to surfactin biosynthesis was found. Strain AB2.0 produced 99.6 mg/l of surfactin in Tryptic Soy Broth after 48 h. The biosurfactant presented an emulsification activity of 45.7\% in this growth condition. It considerably decreased the water surface tension from 72.0 mN/m to 24.7 mN/m and the interfacial tension of n-hexadecane from 30.1 mN/m to 7.5 mN/m, as well as of a medium crude oil from 42.3 mN/m to 6.9 mN/m and of a light crude oil from 36.4 to 3.8 mN/m. Calcite flotation test was conducted to access the wettability reversal of the biosurfactant in high salinity condition similar to that observed in an oil production reservoir, and AB2.0 reversed 100\% using concentrations as low as 25 ppm of biosurfactant. Oil contaminated sand columns were used to simulate microbial enhanced oil recovery at different temperatures and high salinity. When surfactin from AB2.0 was added to the sand columns, the TPH concentration in liquid phases recovered was enhanced up to 24× indicating that AB2.0 is an excellent candidate for its application in MEOR in subsurface environments.},

The role of biosurfactants in natural attenuation processes has not been determined. Very little information is available concerning the influence of soil components on the remediation process with biosurfactants.

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity to meet growing demands of human population is a matter of great concern for all countries. Use of green compounds to achieve the sustainable agriculture is the present necessity. This review highlights the enormous use of harsh surfactants in agricultural soil and agrochemical industries. Biosurfactants which are reported to be produced by bacteria, yeasts, and fungi can serve as green surfactants. Biosurfactants are considered to be less toxic and eco-friendly and thus several types of biosurfactants have the potential to be commercially produced for extensive applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. The biosurfactants synthesized by environmental isolates also has promising role in the agricultural industry. Many rhizosphere and plant associated microbes produce biosurfactant; these biomolecules play vital role in motility, signaling, and biofilm formation, indicating that biosurfactant governs plant–microbe interaction. In agriculture, biosurfactants can be used for plant pathogen elimination and for increasing the bioavailability of nutrient for beneficial plant associated microbes. Biosurfactants can widely be applied for improving the agricultural soil quality by soil remediation. These biomolecules can replace the harsh surfactant presently being used in million dollar pesticide industries. Thus, exploring biosurfactants from environmental isolates for investigating their potential role in plant growth promotion and other related agricultural applications warrants details research. Conventional methods are followed for screening the microbial population for production of biosurfactant. However, molecular methods are fewer in reaching biosurfactants from diverse microbial population and there is need to explore novel biosurfactant from uncultured microbes in soil biosphere by using advanced methodologies like functional metagenomics.},

LPBSs are also involved in multi-cellular behaviors such as swarming motility and biofilm formation. Among the bacterial genera, Bacillus (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas (Gram-negative) have received the most attention because they produce a wide range of effective LPBSs that are potentially useful for agricultural, chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The biosynthetic mechanisms and gene regulation systems of LPBSs have been extensively analyzed over the last decade. LPBSs are generally synthesized in a ribosome-independent manner with megaenzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Production of active-form NRPSs requires not only transcriptional induction and translation but also post-translational modification and assemblage. The accumulated knowledge reveals the versatility and evolutionary lineage of the NRPSs system. This review provides an overview of the structural and functional diversity of LPBSs and their different biosynthetic mechanisms in Bacillus and Pseudomonas, including both typical and unique systems. Finally, successful genetic engineering of NRPSs for creating novel lipopeptides is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, are produced in nature and serve survival functions for the organisms producing them. The antibiotics are a heterogeneous group, the functions of some being related to and others being unrelated to their antimicrobial activities. Secondary metabolites serve: (i) as competitive weapons used against other bacteria, fungi, amoebae, plants, insects, and large animals; (ii) as metal transporting agents; (iii) as agents of symbiosis between microbes and plants, nematodes, insects, and higher animals; (iv) as sexual hormones; and (v) as differentiation effectors. Although antibiotics are not obligatory for sporulation, some secondary metabolites (including antibiotics) stimulate spore formation and inhibit or stimulate germination. Formation of secondary metabolites and spores are regulated by similar factors. This similarity could insure secondary metabolite production during sporulation. Thus the secondary metabolite can: (i) slow down germination of spores until a less competitive environment and more favorable conditions for growth exist; (ii) protect the dormant or initiated spore from consumption by amoebae; or (iii) cleanse the immediate environment of competing microorganisms during germination.},

In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in the development of novel synthetic biology approaches both to increase the production rate of secondary metabolites of interest in native producers and to mine and reconstruct novel biosynthetic gene clusters in heterologous hosts. Here, we present the recent advances toward the engineering of novel microbial biosensors to detect the synthesis of secondary metabolites in bacteria and in the development of synthetic promoters and expression systems aiming at the construction of microbial cell factories for the production of these compounds. We place special focus on the potential of Gram-negative bacteria as a source of biosynthetic gene clusters and hosts for pathway assembly, on the construction and characterization of novel promoters for native hosts, and on the use of computer-aided design of novel pathways and expression systems for secondary metabolite production. Finally, we discuss some of the potentials and limitations of the approaches that are currently being developed and we highlight new directions that could be addressed in the field.},

In addition it has been the basis for strain improvement strategies. Besides the nutritional stimuli (nutritional shift-down), studies have identified several environmental cues that induce secondary metabolism, as well as the mechanisms by which these signals are sensed and transduced, to activate regulatory networks. The first part of this chapter reviews the classic mechanisms that control SM and describes some applications in process and strain improvement. The second section describes the new and expanded view of regulation in their different levels. After this, the findings on SM regulation in solid-state fermentation (SSF), and its relation to SSF-specific environmental cues inducing SMs, are examined. The last section revises actual and potential applications of these new findings to process development and strains genetic improvement.},

Bacillus was identified as the major organism in 23 samples. Toxinogenic Bacillus isolates identified by sperm cell motility inhibition assay were isolated from six samples. Four isolates belonged to the species Bacillus pumilus and two to Bacillus licheniformis. The toxic substances were heat-stable and soluble to methanol thus being of non-protein nature. The methanol extracted substances disrupted the sperm cell plasma membrane permeability barrier at exposure concentrations of 1-15 microg ml(-1) (B. pumilus) or 20-30 microg ml(-1) (B. licheniformis). The toxic properties of the two mastitic B. licheniformis strains were similar to those of B. licheniformis strains known to produce the lipopeptide lichenysin A and the synthetase genes lchAA, lchAB and lchAC for lichenysin were found in the mastitic strains by PCR. Toxin synthetase genes for the syntheses of lichenysin or surfactin were searched but not found in the toxic B. pumilus strains. The ribopatterns of the mastitic B. pumilus and B. licheniformis isolates were similar to those of the toxinogenic strains described earlier from food poisoning incidents and contaminated indoor air. B. licheniformis and B. pumilus survive pasteurization and other heat treatments as spores. Toxin-producing strains of these species in the dairy production chain may thus be of food safety concern.},

The aim of this review was to present the physicochemical and structural properties of surfactin and to demonstrate advances and applications of this biosurfactant for health and environmental biotechnology. Further, this review also focused on toxicological effects of surfactin on in vivo and in in vitro systems. The hydrophobic nature of surfactin enables interaction with membrane-bound phospholipids and indicates the ability of the molecule to act as a new weapon with respect to therapeutic and environmental properties. Seeking to avoid environmental contamination produced by widespread use of synthetic surfactants, surfactin emerges as a biological control agent against pathogen species owing to its antibacterial and antiviral properties. In addition, the mosquitocidal activity of surfactin was suggested as new strategy to control disease vectors. The current findings warrant future research to assess the toxicity of surfactin to enable an optimizing anticancer therapy and to seek refined methodologies, including nanotechnology techniques, to allow for an improved delivery of the biogenic molecule on target cells.},

The multiple activities of lipopeptides have stimulated significant interest in the exploitation of these lipopeptides for use as antibiotics, feed additives, anti-tumor agents, urgent thrombolytic therapeutic agents, and drug delivery systems. Understanding the natural function of these structurally diverse lipopeptides in Bacillus provides insight into microbial regulatory programs and is required for efficient development of more effective products. Currently, there is still insufficient knowledge of the direct target of these lipopeptides, and continued efforts are needed to enhance their biosynthesis efficiency for industrial applications.},

Recently, research has shown that these LPs also contribute to the phenotypic features of Bacillus strains, such as hemolytic activity, swarming motility, biofilm formation, and colony morphology. Bacillus subtilis 916 not only coproduces the three families of well-known LPs, i.e., surfactins, bacillomycin Ls (iturin family), and fengycins, but also produces a new family of LP called locillomycins. The genome of B. subtilis 916 contains four nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene clusters, srf, bmy, fen, and loc, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of surfactins, bacillomycin Ls, fengycins, and locillomycins, respectively. By studying B. subtilis 916 mutants lacking production of one, two, or three LPs, we attempted to unveil the connections between LPs and phenotypic features. We demonstrated that bacillomycin Ls and fengycins contribute mainly to antifungal activity. Although surfactins have weak antifungal activity in vitro, the strain mutated in srfAA had significantly decreased antifungal activity. This may be due to the impaired productions of fengycins and bacillomycin Ls. We also found that the disruption of any LP gene cluster other than fen resulted in a change in colony morphology. While surfactins and bacillomycin Ls play very important roles in hemolytic activity, swarming motility, and biofilm formation, the fengycins and locillomycins had little influence on these phenotypic features. In conclusion, B. subtilis 916 coproduces four families of LPs which contribute to the phenotypic features of B. subtilis 916 in an intricate way.},

These compounds may be utilized for medical and agricultural applications. Here, we summarize the knowledge on structural diversity and underlying gene clusters of LPs and PKs in the Bacillales. Moreover, we evaluate by using published prediction tools the potential metabolic capacity of these bacteria to produce type I PKs or LPs. The huge sequence repository of bacterial genomes and metagenomes provides the basis for such genome-mining to reveal the potential for novel structurally diverse secondary metabolites. The otherwise cumbersome task to isolate often unstable PKs and deduce their structure can be streamlined. Using web based prediction tools, we identified here several novel clusters of PKs and LPs from genomes deposited in the database. Our analysis suggests that a substantial fraction of predicted LPs and type I PKs are uncharacterized, and their functions remain to be studied. Known and predicted LPs and PKs occurred in the majority of the plant associated genera, predominantly in Bacillus and Paenibacillus. Surprisingly, many genera from other environments contain no or few of such compounds indicating the role of these secondary metabolites in plant-associated niches.},

Our analysis suggests that noncanonical nonmodular biosynthetic enzymes are common in bacteria. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria in bacteria and Ascomycota in fungi contained higher number of these gene clusters and are likely to produce a wide variety of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide types of natural products. The data generated here provide a basis for the exploration of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthetic capacity and present a compelling wealth of new information for natural product discovery., Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are a diverse group of natural products with complex chemical structures and enormous pharmaceutical potential. They are synthesized on modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzyme complexes by a conserved thiotemplate mechanism. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of NRPS and PKS genetic machinery across the three domains of life with the discovery of 3,339 gene clusters from 991 organisms, by examining a total of 2,699 genomes. These gene clusters display extraordinarily diverse organizations, and a total of 1,147 hybrid NRPS/PKS clusters were found. Surprisingly, 10\% of bacterial gene clusters lacked modular organization, and instead catalytic domains were mostly encoded as separate proteins. The finding of common occurrence of nonmodular NRPS differs substantially from the current classification. Sequence analysis indicates that the evolution of NRPS machineries was driven by a combination of common descent and horizontal gene transfer. We identified related siderophore NRPS gene clusters that encoded modular and nonmodular NRPS enzymes organized in a gradient. A higher frequency of the NRPS and PKS gene clusters was detected from bacteria compared with archaea or eukarya. They commonly occurred in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria in bacteria and the phylum of Ascomycota in fungi. The majority of these NRPS and PKS gene clusters have unknown end products highlighting the power of genome mining in identifying novel genetic machinery for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.},

	abstract = {Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a proven tertiary recovery technique. Biosurfactant is a microbial bioproduct that plays an important role in MEOR applications. This study aimed to test biosurfactant stability using a design experiment based on response surface methodology. First, isolation and screening for potential biosurfactant-producing bacteria from crude oil samples was performed, followed by their characterization. A biosurfactant core flooding experiment was also conducted to examine bacterial activity on MEOR. Thirty-one sequential isolates of bacteria were screened based on qualitative and semi-qualitative parameters. One selected biosurfactant-producing bacterium was identified as Bacillus licheniformis DS1 based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. This bacterium had the highest emulsification activity (Ei24 = 65.19\%) in light crude oil and could reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water with an effective critical-micelle concentration of 157.5 mg/L. The biosurfactant was observed as a growth-associated metabolite type and the Fourier transform infrared spectrum revealed that the biosurfactant produced belonged to a group of lipopeptides. The biosurfactant has good stability in maintaining emulsification activity at pH 4–10, high temperatures up to 120 °C, and with an NaCl concentration up to 10\% (w/v). Based on response surface methodology using the Box–Behnken experimental design, the optimum condition for the most stable biosurfactant is pH 12, a 40 °C temperature and 10\% salinity, with an Ei24 value of 94.28\%. Core flooding experiments with biosurfactant resulted in 5.4\% additional oil recovery. Therefore, this biosurfactant shows a high potential application for MEOR.},

However, the impact of exposure to low doses of CER has not been studied before. In this research, we investigated the effect of low concentrations of CER on the behavior of intestinal cells using the Caco-2 cell line. The MTT (mitochondrial 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and the SRB (sulforhodamine B) reactions were used to measure the mitochondrial activity and cellular protein content, respectively. Both assays showed that differentiated Caco-2 cells were sensitive to low concentrations of CER (in a MTT reaction of 1 ng/mL after three days of treatment; in an SRB reaction of 0.125 ng/mL after three days of treatment). Cell counts revealed that cells were released from the differentiated monolayer at 0.5 ng/mL of CER. Additionally, 0.5 and 2 ng/mL of CER increased the lactate presence in the cell culture medium. Proteomic data showed that CER at a concentration of 1 ng/mL led to a significant decrease in energy managing and H2O2 detoxification proteins and to an increase in cell death markers. This is amongst the first reports to describe the influence of sub-emetic concentrations of CER on a differentiated intestinal monolayer model showing that low doses may induce an altered enterocyte metabolism and membrane integrity.},

The main focus was on the effect of added organic solvents on the critical micelle concentration (cmc), degree of counterion dissociation on the micelles (α), surface tension at the cmc (γcmc), adsorption efficiency (pC20), effectiveness of surface tension reduction (Πcmc), the maximum surface excess concentration (Γmax), minimum surface area per molecule (Amin) at interface of air/solution and standard Gibbs free energy of micellization (ΔGm∘) of both the investigated surfactants in aqueous solutions. The results show that methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and propylene glycol act as a cosolvent and slightly increase the cmc of both surfactants in aqueous solutions. However the more hydrophobic solvents n-propanol and n-butanol, act as a cosurfactant and decrease the cmc by their presence. The accepted correlations were found between the different interfacial properties and the relative permittivity of the added organic solvents. As the difference between the relative permittivity of added organic solvent and that of pure water becomes smaller than about 35, the adsorption and micellization behavior of the surfactants in different organic solvents–water mixed media shifts to those in pure water. Finally a comparison was made between the surface active imidazolium-based ionic liquids and traditional cationic surfactants in respect to the effects of organic solvents on their surface activity and aggregation behavior in aqueous solutions.},

	abstract = {Background The need for woman-controlled, cheap, safe, effective, easy-to-use and easy-to-store topical applications for prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) makes surfactant-containing formulations an interesting option that requires a more fundamental knowledge concerning surfactant toxicology and structure-activity relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings We report in vitro effects of surfactant concentration, exposure time and structure on the viability of mammalian cell types typically encountered in the vagina, namely, fully polarized and confluent epithelial cells, confluent but non-polarized epithelial-like cells, dendritic cells, and human sperm. Representatives of the different families of commercially available surfactants – nonionic (Triton X-100 and monolaurin), zwitterionic (DDPS), anionic (SDS), and cationic (CnTAB (n = 10 to 16), C12PB, and C12BZK) – were examined. Triton X-100, monolaurin, DDPS and SDS were toxic to all cell types at concentrations around their critical micelle concentration (CMC) suggesting a non-selective mode of action involving cell membrane destabilization and/or destruction. All cationic surfactants were toxic at concentrations far below their CMC and showed significant differences in their toxicity toward polarized as compared with non-polarized cells. Their toxicity was also dependent on the chemical nature of the polar head group. Our results suggest an intracellular locus of action for cationic surfactants and show that their structure-activity relationships could be profitably exploited for STI prophylaxis in vaginal gel formulations. The therapeutic indices comparing polarized epithelial cell toxicity to sperm toxicity for all surfactants examined, except C12PB and C12BZK, does not justify their use as contraceptive agents. C12PB and C12BZK are shown to have a narrow therapeutic index recommending caution in their use in contraceptive formulations. Conclusions/Significance Our results contribute to understanding the mechanisms involved in surfactant toxicity, have a predictive value with regard to their safety, and may be used to design more effective and less harmful surfactants for use in topical applications for STI prophylaxis.},

Here we present the synthesis and the in vitro assaying of a series of lactose-based non-ionic surfactants, highlighting the relationship between their structure and biological effect. Using tensiometric measurements the critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of the surfactants were determined and demonstrate that increasing hydrophobic chain length reduces surfactant CMC. In vitro testing on Caco-2 intestinal and Calu-3 airway epithelia revealed that cytotoxicity, assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays, is presented for most of the surfactants at concentrations greater than their CMCs. Further biological study demonstrates that application of cytotoxic concentrations of the surfactants is associated with depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing nuclear membrane permeability and activation of effector caspases. It is, therefore, proposed that when applied at cytotoxic levels, the surfactants are inducing apoptosis in both cell lines tested. Importantly, through the culture of epithelial monolayers on Transwell\&reg; supports, the surfactants demonstrate the ability to reversibly modulate transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and thus open tight junctions, at non-toxic concentrations, emphasizing their potential application as safe permeability enhancers in vivo.},

	abstract = {The toxic action of surfactant used as a stabilizer of metal nanoparticles have been studied with the aim to determine separate contributions of surfactant monomers and micelles to cell viability decrease. Basing on (1) the well-known ability of surfactant molecules to form micelles in solution at a critical micelle concentration (CMC) and (2) the results reported in literature, showing that toxicity of various surfactants increases when their concentration exceeds CMC, we supposed that surfactant molecules and micelles may differ in their toxic effect on cells. This supposition was verified on the anionic surfactant aerosol-OT (AOT) used as a stabilizer of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in studies of their cytotoxicity on Jurkat cells by means of the MTT test. Two samples of AgNPs stabilized with AOT in concentrations higher (3 mM) and lower (1 mM) than its CMC in water were introduced to the cell medium as water solutions diluted to obtain nanoparticle concentrations in the range 1–7 μg/mL. Cell viability changes were registered after 24 h incubation. It was found that AgNPs of similar average size (about 16 nm), synthesized by the same procedure, introduced to the same concentrations in cell medium, produced a different effect on cell viability. Namely, decrease in cell viability was observed for AgNPs with 3 mM AOT, while no noticeable changes were registered for AgNPs with 1 mM AOT. A similar difference was detected for the corresponding dilutions of 3 mM and 1 mM AOT water solutions. We assumed that the toxicity dependence on AOT concentration originated from the difference in toxic action of the two different AOT forms – molecules (monomers) and micelles – present in the AgNPs and AOT solution. The approach was suggested for estimation of the separate contributions of monomers and micelles to the total AOT toxicity; changes of these contributions with AgNPs or AOT concentration were also determined. The results obtained may prove to be useful in studies of the biological activity of surfactants applied both as nanoparticle stabilizers and as agents working in medicine as suppressors of various infections.},

	abstract = {The inception and development of supramolecular chemistry have provided a vast library of supramolecular structures and materials for improved practice of medicine. In the context of therapeutic delivery, while supramolecular nanostructures offer a wide variety of morphologies as drug carriers for optimized targeting and controlled release, concerns are often raised as to how their morphological stability and structural integrity impact their in vivo performance. After intravenous (i.v.) administration, the intrinsic reversible and dynamic feature of supramolecular assemblies may lead them to dissociate upon plasma dilution to a concentration below their critical micellization concentration (CMC). As such, CMC represents an important characteristic for supramolecular biomaterials design, but its pharmaceutical role remains elusive. Here, we report the design of a series of self-assembling prodrugs (SAPDs) that spontaneously associate in aqueous solution into supramolecular polymers (SPs) with varying CMCs. Two hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) molecules were conjugated onto oligoethylene-glycol (OEG)-decorated segments with various OEG repeat numbers (2, 4, 6, 8). Our studies show that the lower the CMC, the lower the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in rodents. When administrated at the same dosage of 10 mg/kg (CPT equivalent), SAPD 1, the one with the lowest CMC, shows the best efficacy in tumor suppression. These observations can be explained by the circulation and dissociation of SAPD SPs and the difference in molecular and supramolecular distribution between excretion and organ uptake. We believe these findings offer important insight into the role of supramolecular stability in determining their therapeutic index and in vivo efficacy.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: GA1 was first tested for its ability to antagonize in vitro the growth of a wide variety of plant pathogenic fungi responsible for diseases of economical importance. The potential of strain GA1 to reduce post-harvest infection caused by B. cinerea was tested on apples by treating artificially wounded fruits with endospore suspensions. Strain GA1 was very effective at reducing disease incidence during the first 5 days following pathogen inoculation and a 80\% protection level was maintained over the next 10 days. Treatment of fruits with an extract of GA1 culture supernatant also exerted a strong preventive effect on the development of grey mould. Further analysis of this extract revealed that strain GA1 produces a wide variety of antifungal lipopeptide isomers from the iturin, fengycin and surfactin families. A strong evidence for the involvement of such compounds in disease reduction arose from the recovery of fengycins from protected fruit sites colonized by bacterial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here demonstrate that, despite unfavourable pH, B. subtilis endospores inoculated on apple pulp can readily germinate allowing significant cell populations to establish and efficient in vivo synthesis of lipopeptides which could be related to grey mould reduction.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work enables for the first time to correlate the strong protective effect of a particular B. subtilis strain against grey mould with in situ production of fengycins in infected sites of apple fruits.},

	abstract = {A kinetic model of bacterial growth and metabolite production can adequately explain the trends and interaction of important parameters in a fermentation process. Production of surfactin by two bacterial strains, namely, Bacillus subtilis MSH1 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21322, in a 5 L bioreactor was investigated using Cooper’s media with 4\% (v/v) glucose. The present kinetic study was carried out in order to determine the correlation between microbial cell growth, surfactin production and glucose consumption. Batch fermentation was performed by cultivation of each selected strain in a bioreactor at 30°C for 55 h. The experimental results showed production of surfactin in the culture medium after 5 and 10 h of incubation for B. subtilis ATCC 21332 and B. subtilis MSH1, respectively, at which the bacterial cells were at an early stage of the log phase. The maximum concentration of surfactin (Pmax) achieved by B. subtilis MSH1 and B. subtilis ATCC 21332 was 226.17 and 447.26 mg/L, respectively. The kinetic study of bacterial cell growth of both strains indicated that B. subtilis MSH1 had a specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.224 h-1 and attained a maximum biomass concentration (Xmax) as high as 2.90 g/L after 28 h of fermentation, while B. subtilis ATCC 21332, with μmax of 0.087 h-1, attained an Xmax of 2.62 g/L after 45 h of incubation. B. subtilis MSH1 showed higher growth kinetics, thus exhibited higher values of μmax and Xmax compared with B. subtilis ATCC 21332 under identical fermentation conditions. The Pmax achieved by B. subtilis ATCC 21332 was 447.26 mg/L, two times higher than that achieved by B. subtilis MSH1 (226.17 mg/L). The results obtained provide kinetics information including values of Pmax, μmax and Xmax for better understanding of interactions of bacterial cell growth and glucose consumption towards surfactin production by a commercial strain of B. subtilis ATCC 21332 and a local isolate of B. subtilis MSH1.},

The application of QSAR to their aquatic toxicity is complicated by the fact that they are multicomponent mixtures, the parent alcohols being often mixtures of isomers and homologues, each one being ethoxylated to varying degrees. A spreadsheet method for calculation of aquatic toxicity of such nonionic surfactant mixtures is presented. The method is based on a combination of the Könemann narcosis QSAR and mixture toxicity equations based on the principle of concentration addition. Log P values used in the spreadsheet calculations are themselves calculated by spreadsheet formulae based on the Leo and Hansch method modified by incorporation of the position dependent branching factor originally applied to linear alkylbenzene sulphonates. Close agreement between calculated and experimental EC50 values (48 hr Daphnia tests) is obtained for a range of ethoxylated alcohols having a diversity of branching patterns, carbon numbers and degrees of ethoxylation. The effects of increasing carbon number (decreasing EC50), branching (increasing EC50) and increasing degree of ethoxylation (increasing EC50) are all quantified.},

	abstract = {Lichenysin is a biodegradable surfactant with huge potential for recovering crude oil from the oil reservoir. The current production of lichenysin is made through fermentation from wild strain of Bacillus licheniformis, which is limited by low yield. The aim of this work was to improve lichenysin-producing capability of a wide strain B. licheniformis WX-02. Lichenysin produced from WX-02 was first extracted, purified, and identified. Through the substitution of the promoter of lichenysin biosynthesis operon, the mutants B. licheniformis WX02-P43lch, WX02-Pxyllch, and WX02-Psrflch were constructed with the constitutive promoter (P43), the xylose-inducible promoter (P xyl ), and the surfactin operon promoter (P srf ), respectively. A consistent change trend was observed between lichenysin production and lchAA gene transcription, confirming the strength of the promoters as an important factor for lichenysin synthesis. Among the three mutants, WX02-Psrflch produced the highest lichenysin yield. The production by the mutant WX02-Psrflch was further improved with the optimization of the major medium components including glucose, NH4NO3, and Na2HPO4/KH2PO4. Under 30 g/L glucose, 5 g/L NH4NO3, and 80 mM/60 mM Na2HPO4/KH2PO4, the strain WX02-Psrflch produced 2,149 mg/L lichenysin, a 16.8-fold improvement compared to that of wild strain WX-02.},

	abstract = {Nonvolatile components influence overall flavor volatility and perception in alcoholic beverages. However, little information has been reported about the nonvolatile compounds in Chinese distilled spirits. For the first time, we isolated and identified a cyclic lipopeptide "lichenysin" as a novel nonvolatile compound in Chinese liquors, using preparative high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer and nuclear magnetic resonance. The concentrations of lichenysin were quantified in 14 main types of bottled Chinese liquors by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The concentrations of lichenysin in Chinese liquor ranged from 0.01 to 111.74 μg/L, where the concentration was the highest in Dongjiu liquor. Furthermore, we found that lichenysin selectively affected aroma volatility in the Chinese liquor, using the headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The headspace concentrations of 2-phenylethanol, phenol, and 4-methylphenol significantly decreased by respectively 58\%, 76\%, and 59\% in 3 Chinese commercial liquors with an increase in lichenysin. These results indicated that lichenysin could be a novel nonvolatile compound that selectively affected aroma volatility in Chinese liquors.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This was the first report that lichenysin was isolated, identified, and quantified as a nonvolatile compound in traditional Chinese liquors. Lichenysin selectively affected the volatility of the aroma compounds in Chinese liquors. So far, there is no report on lichenysin in other alcoholic beverages. It would give a new insight into flavoromics in food and help to improve aroma quality of Chinese liquors.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that an amphipathic structure and a threshold of hydrophobicity of the peptidic chain are crucial for the biological function of AMPs (antimicrobial peptides). However, the factors that dictate their cell selectivity are not yet clear. In the present study, we show that the attachment of aliphatic acids with different lengths (10, 12, 14 or 16 carbon atoms) to the N-terminus of a biologically inactive cationic peptide is sufficient to endow the resulting lipopeptides with lytic activity against different cells. Mode-of-action studies were performed with model phospholipid membranes mimicking those of bacterial, mammalian and fungal cells. These include determination of the structure in solution and membranes by using CD and ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy, membrane leakage experiments and by visualizing bacterial and fungal damage via transmission electron microscopy. The results obtained reveal that: (i) the short lipopeptides (10 and 12 carbons atoms) are non-haemolytic, active towards both bacteria and fungi and monomeric in solution. (ii) The long lipopeptides (14 and 16 carbons atoms) are highly antifungal, haemolytic only at concentrations above their MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values and aggregate in solution. (iii) All the lipopeptides adopt a partial alpha-helical structure in 1\% lysophosphatidylcholine and bacterial and mammalian model membranes. However, the two short lipopeptides contain a significant fraction of random coil in fungal membranes, in agreement with their reduced antifungal activity. (iv) All the lipopeptides have a membranolytic effect on all types of cells assayed. Overall, the results reveal that the length of the aliphatic chain is sufficient to control the pathogen specificity of the lipopeptides, most probably by controlling both the overall hydrophobicity and the oligomeric state of the lipopeptides in solution. Besides providing us with basic important information, these new lipopeptides are potential candidates that can target bacteria and/or fungi, especially in cases where the bacterial flora should not be harmed.},

Owing to their amphipathic nature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) serve as the first line of defense of the innate immune system. The ability to synthesize different types of AMPs enables exploitation of their advantages as alternatives to antibiotics. Sustained release of AMPs incorporated in biodegradable polymers can be advantageous in maintaining high levels of the peptides. In this study, four potent ultra-short lipopeptides, conjugated to an aliphatic acid chain (16C) were incorporated in two different biodegradable polymers: poly (lactic acid co castor oil) (PLACO) and ricinoleic acid-based poly (ester-anhydride) (P(SA-RA)) for sustained release. The lipopeptide and polymer formulations were tested for antibacterial activity during one week, by turbidometric measurements of bacterial outgrowth, anti-biofilm activity by live/dead staining, biocompatibility by hemolysis and XTT colorimetric assays, mode of action by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and release profile by a fluorometric assay. The results show that an antibacterial and anti-biofilm effect, as well as membrane disruption, can be achieved by the use of a formulation of lipopeptide incorporated in biodegradable polymer.},

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and caspase-3/7 assays revealed that the cytotoxicity and cellular membrane disruption of HepG2 cells induced by PDMAEMA depend on both the polymer concentration and chain length, and the apoptosis depends on chain length at the concentration of 37.6 μg/mL. In the concentration range 10−110 μg/mL, PDMAEMA chains with different lengths are cytotoxic to HepG2 cells by different mechanisms. Namely, (1) for short PDMAEMA chains [Mw = (1.1−1.7) × 104 g/mol], the cytotoxicity, membrane disruption, and apoptosis are very low, independent of the chain length; (2) in the medium range (1.7 × 104 {\textless} Mw {\textless} 3.9 × 104 g/mol), the cytotoxicity increases with the chain length and polymer concentration, mainly due to the cooperative effect of membrane disruption and apoptosis; and (3) for long chains [Mw = (3.9−4.8) × 104 g/mol], they are very disruptive to the cellular membrane, pro-apoptotic, and able to enter the cytoplasm and nucleus faster than short chains, as revealed by the real-time confocal laser scanning microscopy images, and their much higher cytotoxicity is independent of the PDMAEMA chain length.},

Thus, optimization of the growth medium for biosurfactant-lichenysin production by Bacillus licheniformis R2 was carried out using response-surface methodology. A preliminary screening phase based on a two-level fractional factorial design led to the identification of NH4NO3, glucose, Na2HPO4 and MnSO4·4H2O concentrations as the most significant variables affecting the fermentation process. The 24 full-factorial central composite design was then applied to further optimize the biosurfactant production. The optimal levels of the aforementioned variables were (g/l): NH4NO3, 1.0; glucose, 34.0; KH2PO4, 6.0; Na2HPO4, 2.7; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1; CaCl2, 1.2×10−3; FeSO4·7H2O, 1.65×10−3; MnSO4·4H2O, 1.5×10−3 and Na–EDTA, 2.2×10−3.

They have unusual structures and their production arises from intracellular intermediates (amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, etc.), which are condensed into more complex structures by defined biochemical pathways. They are not essential for the growth of the producing cultures, but serve diverse survival functions in nature. They are very important for the human health and economics of our society. They include antibiotics, antitumor agents, cholesterol-lowering drugs, immunosuppressants, antihelmintic agents and other antiparasitics, herbicides, ruminant growth stimulators, agricultural fungicides, bio-insecticides, and others. The most important secondary metabolites have been the anti-infective drugs and, among these, the β-lactams are the most important class. Other important classes include the aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, lipopeptides, polyenes, and the echinocandins. Successful microbial secondary metabolites include many used to combat cancer, such as the anthracycline doxorubicin and bleomycin. Antitumor agents from plants that have been very useful are taxol and camptothecin. If modern medicine is to continue in its present form, novel families of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites must continue to be discovered and enter the marketplace at regular intervals.},

The group has long been recognised to produce a range of secondary metabolites and, despite their long history of safe usage, this has resulted in an increased focus on their safety. Traditional methods used to detect the production of secondary metabolites and other potentially harmful compounds have relied on phenotypic tests. Such approaches are time consuming and, in some cases, lack specificity. Nowadays, accessibility to genome data and associated bioinformatical tools provides a powerful means for identifying gene clusters associated with the synthesis of secondary metabolites. This review focuses primarily on well-characterised strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis and their synthesis of non-ribosomally synthesised peptides and polyketides. Where known, the activities and toxicities of their secondary metabolites are discussed, together with the limitations of assays currently used to assess their toxicity.

	abstract = {Several experimental and theoretical studies have extensively investigated the effects of a large diversity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) on model lipid bilayers and living cells. Many of these peptides disturb cells by forming pores in the plasma membrane that eventually lead to the cell death. The complexity of these peptide–lipid interactions is mainly related to electrostatic, hydrophobic and topological issues of these counterparts. Diverse studies have shed some light on how AMPs act on lipid bilayers composed by different phospholipids, and how mechanical properties of membranes could affect the antimicrobial effects of such compounds. On the other hand, cyclic lipopeptides (cLPs), an important class of microbial secondary metabolites, have received comparatively less attention. Due to their amphipathic structures, cLPs exhibit interesting biological activities including interactions with biofilms, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-tumoral properties, which deserve more investigation. Understanding how physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers contribute and determining the antagonistic activity of these secondary metabolites over a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens could establish a framework to design and select effective strategies of biological control. This implies unravelling—at the biophysical level—the complex interactions established between cLPs and lipid bilayers. This review presents, in a systematic manner, the diversity of lipidated antibiotics produced by different microorganisms, with a critical analysis of the perturbing actions that have been reported in the literature for this specific set of membrane-active lipopeptides during their interactions with model membranes and in vivo. With an overview on the mechanical properties of lipid bilayers that can be experimentally determined, we also discuss which parameters are relevant in the understanding of those perturbation effects. Finally, we expose in brief, how this knowledge can help to design novel strategies to use these biosurfactants in the agronomic and pharmaceutical industries.},

Strain CO100 exhibited a high capacity to break down almost 72\% of the aliphatic hydrocarbons contained in crude oil (1\%, v/v), used as the sole carbon and energy source, after 20 days of culture, at 100 g/l NaCl, 37 °C and 180 rpm. The isolate CO100 displayed also its ability to grow on phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene (100 mg/l), at 100 g/l NaCl. Moreover, the isolate CO100 showed a notable aptitude to synthesize an efficient tensioactive agent namely BS-CO100, on low-value substrates including residual frying oil and expired milk powder, thus reducing the high cost of biosurfactant production. The ESI/MS analysis designated that BS-CO100 belonged to lipopeptide class, in particular lichenysin and iturine members. Critical micelle concentrations of BS-CO100 were varying between 65 and 750 mg/l, depending on of the purity of the biosurfactant and the used carbon sources. BS-CO100 showed a high steadiness against a wide spectrum of pH (4.3-12), temperature (4-121 °C) and salinity (0-300 g/l NaCl), supporting its powerful tensioactive properties under various environmental conditions. Likewise, BS-CO100 exhibited no cytotoxic effect toward human HEK293 cells, at concentrations within 125 and 1000 μg/ml. Furthermore, the biosurfactant BS-CO100 exhibited remarkable anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities, being able to avoid and disrupt the biofilm formation by certain pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, BS-CO100 was found to have more potential to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated soils, compared to some chemical surfactants. In light of these promising findings, strain CO100, as well as its biosurfactant, could be successfully used in different biotechnological applications including the bioremediation of oil-polluted areas, even under saline conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: We previously established long-term culture conditions under which single crypts or stem cells derived from mouse small intestine expand over long periods. The expanding crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells. We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon.
METHODS: Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized the mouse and human colon culture systems.
RESULTS: Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition of nicotinamide, along with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk and an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells, and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a technology that can be used to study infected, inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal tract. These tools might have applications in regenerative biology through ex vivo expansion of the intestinal epithelia. Studies of these cultures indicate that there is no inherent restriction in the replicative potential of adult stem cells (or a Hayflick limit) ex vivo.},

Both in its varied natural habitats and in industrial settings, B. licheniformis cells will be exposed to increases in the external osmolarity, conditions that trigger water efflux, impair turgor, cause the cessation of growth, and negatively affect the productivity of cell factories in biotechnological processes. We have taken here both systems-wide and targeted physiological approaches to unravel the core of the osmostress responses of B. licheniformis. Cells were suddenly subjected to an osmotic upshift of considerable magnitude (with 1 M NaCl), and their transcriptional profile was then recorded in a time-resolved fashion on a genome-wide scale. A bioinformatics cluster analysis was used to group the osmotically up-regulated genes into categories that are functionally associated with the synthesis and import of osmostress-relieving compounds (compatible solutes), the SigB-controlled general stress response, and genes whose functional annotation suggests that salt stress triggers secondary oxidative stress responses in B. licheniformis. The data set focusing on the transcriptional profile of B. licheniformis was enriched by proteomics aimed at identifying those proteins that were accumulated by the cells through increased biosynthesis in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, these global approaches were augmented by a set of experiments that addressed the synthesis of the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine and assessed the growth-enhancing effects of various osmoprotectants. Combined, our data provide a blueprint of the cellular adjustment processes of B. licheniformis to both sudden and sustained osmotic stress.},

The temperature at which spores were inactivated with a decimal reduction time of 10 min was in the range of 75 to 121 degrees C. This temperature was 46 +/- 7 degrees C higher than the maximum growth temperature and correlated with it and the other cell parameters.

Many of the currently available antimicrobial agents for agriculture are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable and thus cause extended environmental pollution. Moreover, an increasing number of phytopathogens have developed resistance to antimicrobial agents. The lipopeptides have been tried as potent versatile weapons to deal with a variety of phytopathogens. All the three families of Bacillus lipopeptides, namely, Surfactins, Iturins and Fengycins, have been explored for their antagonistic activities towards a wide range of phytopathogens including bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. Iturin and Fengycin have antifungal activities, while Surfactin has broad range of potent antibacterial activities and this has also been used as larvicidal agent. Interestingly, lipopeptides being the molecules of biological origin are environmentally acceptable.},

In general, USCLs consist of fatty acid chains and a few basic amino acid residues. The main shortcoming of USCLs is their relatively high cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. This study focuses on the impact of the hydrophobic fatty acid chain, on both antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. To learn more about this region, a series of USCLs with different straight-chain fatty acids (C8, C10, C12, C14) attached to the tripeptide with two arginine residues were synthesized. The amino acid at the N-terminal position was exchanged for proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acid residues (24 in total). Moreover, the branched fatty acid residues were conjugated to N-terminus of a dipeptide with two arginine residues. All USCLs had C-terminal amides. USCLs were tested against reference bacterial strains (including ESKAPE group) and Candida albicans. The hemolytic potential was tested on human erythrocytes. Hydrophobicity of the compounds was evaluated by RP-HPLC. Shortening of the fatty acid chain and simultaneous addition of amino acid residue at N-terminus were expected to result in more selective and active compounds than those of the reference lipopeptides with similar lipophilicity. Hypothetically, this approach would also be beneficial to other antimicrobial peptides where N-lipidation strategy was used to improve their biological characteristics.},

In a nutshell, the process of chain-length regulation can be understood as the output of a chain-elongating C-C bond forming reaction competing with a terminating fatty acid release function. At the end of each cycle in the iterative process, the synthesizing enzymes need to "decide" whether the growing chain is to be elongated through another cycle or released as the "mature" fatty acid. Recent research has shed light on the factors determining fatty acid chain length and has also achieved control over chain length for the production of the technologically interesting short-chain (C4 -C8 ) and medium-chain (C10 -C14 ) fatty acids.},

In this study, the effect of the acyl chain length of ultrashort LiPs (CX-KYR-NH2; X=10, 12, 14 and 16) on their bacterial killing and membrane disruption kinetics was investigated. The geometric mean of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for 4 pathogenic bacterial strains was 25μM, with a selectivity index of 10.24 for C14-KYR-NH2. LiPs at all concentrations exhibited no cytotoxicity towards human erythrocytes, but towards Vero cells at 80μM. All the LiPs adopted secondary structure in a membrane mimicking environment. C14-KYR-NH2 aggregated above 256μM, while C16-KYR-NH2 did above 80μM. All LiPs showed outer membrane permeabilization within 3min after treatment, yet the extent and kinetics of inner membrane penetration and depolarization were dependent on the acyl chain length. Cell death subsequently occurred within 10min, and killing activity appeared to correlate most with depolarization activity but not with outer or inner membrane permeability. AFM imaging of cells treated with C14-KYR-NH2 revealed rupture of the cell surface and cytosolic leakage depending on the length of incubation. This study highlights and follows the progression of events that occur during the membrane disintegration process over time, and determines the optimal amphipathicity of ultrashort LiPs with 12–14 carbon atoms for this membrane disrupting activity. The fast acting bactericidal properties of ultrashort LiPs with optimal chain lengths make them promising candidates for drug lead compounds.},

However, Bacillus probiotics can also produce toxins and biogenic amines and transfer antibiotic resistance genes; therefore, their safety is a concern. Studies on the microbiome using probiotic Bacillus strains are limited in humans. Most microbiome research has been conducted in chicken, mouse, and pig. Some Bacillus probiotics are used as fermentation starters in plant and soybean and dietary supplement of baking foods as a probiotic carrier. This review summarizes the characterization of Bacillus species as probiotics for human use and their safety, microbiome, and probiotic carrier.},

	abstract = {Spore-forming bacilli are being explored for the production and preservation of food for many centuries. The inherent ability of production of large number of secretory proteins, enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, vitamins, and carotenoids specifies the importance of bacilli in food chain. Additionally, Bacillus spp. are gaining interest in human health related functional food research coupled with their enhanced tolerance and survivability under hostile environment of gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Besides, bacilli are more stable during processing and storage of food and pharmaceutical preparations, making them more suitable candidate for health promoting formulations. Further, Bacillus strains also possess biotherapeutic potential which is connected with their ability to interact with the internal milieu of the host by producing variety of antimicrobial peptides and small extracellular effector molecules. Nonetheless, with proposed scientific evidences, commercial probiotic supplements and functional foods comprising of Bacillus spp. had not gained much credential in general population, since the debate over probiotic vs pathogen tag of Bacillus in the research and production terrains is confusing consumers. Hence, it’s important to clearly understand the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of selective beneficial Bacillus spp. and their substantiation with those having GRAS status, to reach a consensus over the same. This review highlights the probiotic candidature of spore forming Bacillus spp. and presents an overview of the proposed health benefits, including application in food and pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the growing need to evaluate the safety of individual Bacillus strains as well as species on a case by case basis and necessity of more profound analysis for the selection and identification of Bacillus probiotic candidates are also taken into consideration.},

These organisms have undergone huge taxonomic changes in the last 30 years, with numbers of genera and species now standing at 56 and over 545, respectively. Despite this expansion, relatively few new species have been isolated from infections, few are associated with food and no important new agents of foodborne illness have been reported. What has changed is our knowledge of the established agents. Bacillus cereus is well known as a cause of food poisoning, and much more is now understood about its toxins and their involvement in infections and intoxications. Also, although B. licheniformis, B. subtilis and B. pumilus have occasionally been isolated from cases of food-associated illness, their roles were usually uncertain. Much more is now known about the toxins that strains of these species may produce, so that their significances in such episodes are clearer; however, it is still unclear why such cases are so rarely reported. Another important development is the use of aerobic endosporeformers as probiotics, as the potentials of such organisms to cause illness or to be sources of antibiotic resistance need to be borne in mind.},

The toxin detection method, based on the inhibition of boar spermatozoan motility, has been shown previously to be a sensitive assay for the emetic toxin of Bacillus cereus, cereulide. Cell extracts of the toxigenic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited sperm motility, damaged cell membrane integrity, depleted cellular ATP, and swelled the acrosome, but no mitochondrial damage was observed. The responsible agent from the B. licheniformis isolates was partially purified. It showed physicochemical properties similar to those of cereulide, despite having very different biological activity. The toxic agent was nonproteinaceous; soluble in 50 and 100\% methanol; and insensitive to heat, protease, and acid or alkali and of a molecular mass smaller than 10,000 g mol−1. The toxic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited growth of Corynebacterium renale DSM 20688T, but not all inhibitory isolates were sperm toxic. The food poisoning-related isolates were beta-hemolytic, grew anaerobically and at 55°C but not at 10°C, and were nondistinguishable from the type strain of B. licheniformis, DSM 13T, by a broad spectrum of biochemical tests. Ribotyping revealed more diversity; the toxin producers were divided among four ribotypes when cut with PvuII and among six when cut with EcoRI, but many of the ribotypes also contained nontoxigenic isolates. When ribotyped with PvuII, most toxin-producing isolates shared bands at 2.8 ± 0.2, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 11.7 ± 0.5 or 13.1 ± 0.8 kb.},

However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including small intestine specific genes, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most small intestine-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.},

Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells in 96-well culture plates were exposed to known toxic (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, ethionine, flufenamic acid, and diflunisal) and control (transplatin, 5-chlorouracil, methionine, and acetylsalicylic acid) compounds for 1-3 days, and resazurin (5 micromol/L) was added. A conventional short-term (1 h) assay was first performed, where cytotoxicity is indicated by decreased reduction of resazurin to its fluorescent product resorufin. Our improved assay consists of additionally measuring fluorescence 2-4 days later, when cytotoxicity is indicated by a striking increase in the concentration of resorufin, resulting from two distinct processes. First, viable liver-derived cells slowly convert resorufin to nonfluorescent metabolites. Fluorescence of control cell wells decreased to background during a 2- to 4-day exposure to resazurin. This metabolism of resorufin was largely blocked by dicumarol and to lesser extents by disulfiram and SKF525a. Second, dead or dying cells slowly convert resazurin to resorufin but do not further metabolize resorufin; thus this fluorescent metabolite accumulates to high levels in wells with dead cells by 2 to 4 days. A similar increase in fluorescence associated with cytotoxicity was observed in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes using the long-term resazurin-based assay. In addition to an improved signal relative to the short-term assay, the inversion of the fluorescent signal from high = alive short-term to high = dead long-term allows determination of two independent cytotoxicity endpoints after addition of one innocuous vital dye.},

Except for terfenadine and astemizole, which performed consistently in both assays, the alamar blue assay was slightly more sensitive than the MTT assay for most compounds. The MTT assay was less sensitive detecting an effect for daunorubicin and trifluoperazine. Seven drugs, astemizole, daunorubicin, ellipticine, fluphenazine, terfenadine, thioridazine and trifluoperazine, had percent viability results of 55\% or less in the alamar blue assay at the single point screen. These were re-tested in both assays for reconfirmation of cytotoxicity and determination of the EC50 values. Except for daunorubicin, the EC50 values were comparable in both assays. Based on these results and the Z'-factor assessment of assay quality, both assays provided useful information to identify in vitro cytotoxic drugs at early stages of drug candidate selection. However, careful interpretation of data is warranted due to the possibility of false positive or negative results caused by inducers and/or inhibitors of metabolic enzymes that are responsible for transformation of cell toxicity end points, as we demonstrated using dicumarol.},

	abstract = {The rapid discovery of sequence information from the Human Genome Project has exponentially increased the amount of data that can be retrieved from biomedical experiments. Gene expression profiling, through the use of microarray technology, is rapidly contributing to an improved understanding of global, coordinated cellular events in a variety of paradigms. In the field of toxicology, the potential application of toxicogenomics to indicate the toxicity of unknown compounds has been suggested but remains largely unsubstantiated to date. A major supposition of toxicogenomics is that global changes in the expression of individual mRNAs (i.e., the transcriptional responses of cells to toxicants) will be sufficiently distinct, robust, and reproducible to allow discrimination of toxicants from different classes. Definitive demonstration is still lacking for such specific “genetic fingerprints,” as opposed to nonspecific general stress responses that may be indistinguishable between compounds and therefore not suitable as probes of toxic mechanisms. The present studies demonstrate a general application of toxicogenomics that distinguishes two mechanistically unrelated classes of toxicants (cytotoxic anti-inflammatory drugs and DNA-damaging agents) based solely upon a cluster-type analysis of genes differentially induced or repressed in cultured cells during exposure to these compounds. Initial comparisons of the expression patterns for 100 toxic compounds, using all ∼ 250 genes on a DNA microarray (∼ 2.5 million data points), failed to discriminate between toxicant classes. A major obstacle encountered in these studies was the lack of reproducible gene responses, presumably due to biological variability and technological limitations. Thus multiple replicate observations for the prototypical DNA damaging agent, cisplatin, and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diflunisal and flufenamic acid were made, and a subset of genes yielding reproducible inductions/repressions was selected for comparison. Many of the “fingerprint genes” identified in these studies were consistent with previous observations reported in the literature (e.g., the well-characterized induction by cisplatin of p53-regulated transcripts such as p21waf1/cip1 and PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]). These gene subsets not only discriminated among the three compounds in the learning set but also showed predictive value for the rest of the database (∼ 100 compounds of various toxic mechanisms). Further refinement of the clustering strategy, using a computer-based optimization algorithm, yielded even better results and demonstrated that genes that ultimately best discriminated between DNA damage and NSAIDs were involved in such diverse processes as DNA repair, xenobiotic metabolism, transcriptional activation, structural maintenance, cell cycle control, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The determination of genes whose responses appropriately group and dissociate anti-inflammatory versus DNA-damaging agents provides an initial paradigm upon which to build for future, higher throughput-based identification of toxic compounds using gene expression patterns alone.},

	abstract = {Aims The aim of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of lichenysin production in Bacillus licheniformis and to see whether this feature was restricted to certain genotypes. Secondly, we wanted to see whether cytotoxicity reflected the measured levels of lichenysin. Methods and Results Fifty-three genotyped strains of B. licheniformis, representing a wide variety of sources, were included. lchAA gene fragments were detected in all strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All 53 strains produced lichenysins with four molecular masses as confirmed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) analysis. The amounts of lichenysin varied more than two orders of magnitude between strains and were irrespective of genotype. Finally, there was a strong association between lichenysin concentrations and toxicity towards boar spermatozoa, erythrocytes and Vero cells. Conclusions Lichenysin synthesis was universal among the 53 B. licheniformis strains examined. The quantities varied considerably between strains, but were not specifically associated with genotype. Cytotoxicity was evident at lichenysin concentrations above 10 μg ml−1, which is in accordance with previous studies. Significance and Impact of Study This study might be of interest to those working on B. licheniformis for commercial use as well as for authorities who make risk assessments of B. licheniformis when used as a food and feed additive.},

	abstract = {Bacterial endospore formers can produce spores that are resistant to many food processing conditions, including heat. Some spores may survive heating processes aimed at production of commercially sterile foods. Recently, it was shown that a spoVA operon, designated spoVA2mob, present on a Tn1546 transposon in Bacillus subtilis, leads to profoundly increased wet heat resistance of B. subtilis spores. Such Tn1546 transposon elements including the spoVA2mob operon were also found in several strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus licheniformis, and these strains were shown to produce spores with significantly higher resistances to wet heat than their counterparts lacking this transposon. In this study, the locations and compositions of Tn1546 transposons encompassing the spoVA2mob operons in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis were analyzed. Introduction of these spoVA2mob operons into B. subtilis 168 (producing spores that are not highly heat resistant) rendered mutant 168 strains that produced high-level heat resistant spores, demonstrating that these elements in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis are responsible for high level heat resistance of spores. Assessment of growth of the nine strains of each species between 5.2°C and 57.7°C showed some differences between strains, especially at lower temperatures, but all strains were able to grow at 57.7°C. Strains of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis that contain the Tn1546 elements (and produce high-level heat resistant spores) grew at temperatures similar to those of their Tn1546-negative counterparts that produce low-level heat resistant spores. The findings presented in this study allow for detection of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis strains that produce highly heat resistant spores in the food chain.},

	abstract = {The glucose and nitrogen starvation stimulons of Bacillus licheniformis were determined by transcriptome and proteome analyses. Under both starvation conditions, the main response of B. licheniformis was a switch to the usage of alternative nutrient sources. This was indicated by an induction of genes involved in the metabolism of C-2 substrates during glucose limitation. In addition, B. licheniformis seems to be using other organic substances like amino acids and lipids as carbon sources when subjected to glucose starvation. This observation is supported by the induction of a high number of genes coding for proteins involved in amino acid and lipid degradation. During nitrogen starvation, genes for several proteases and peptidases involved in nitrate and nitrite assimilation were induced, which enables this bacterium to recruit nitrogen from alternative sources. Both starvation conditions led to a down-regulation of transcription of most vegetative genes, which was subsequently reflected by a reduced synthesis of the corresponding proteins. A selected set of genes was induced by both starvation conditions. Among them were yvyD, citA and the putative methylcitrate shunt genes mmgD, mmgE and yqiQ. However, both starvation conditions did not induce a general SigmaB-dependent stress response.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive firmicute that causes foodborne infections, in part due to its ability to use multiple strategies, including biofilm formation, to survive adverse growth conditions. As a potential way to screen for genes required for biofilm formation, we harnessed the ability of bacteria to accumulate mutations in the genome over time, diverging the properties of seemingly identical strains. By sequencing the genomes of four laboratory reference strains of the commonly used L. monocytogenes EGDe, we showed that each isolate contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference genome. We discovered that two SNPs, contained in two independent genes within one of the isolates, impacted biofilm formation. Using bacterial genetics and phenotypic assays, we confirmed that rsbU and rmlA influence biofilm formation. RsbU is the upstream regulator of the alternative sigma factor SigB, and mutation of either rsbU or sigB increased biofilm formation. In contrast, deletion of rmlA, which encodes the first enzyme for TDP-l-rhamnose biosynthesis, resulted in a reduction in the amount of biofilm formed. Further analysis of biofilm formation in a strain that still produces TDP-l-rhamnose but which cannot decorate the wall teichoic acid with rhamnose (rmlT mutant) showed that it is the decorated wall teichoic acid that is required for adhesion of the cells to surfaces. Together, these data uncover novel routes by which biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes can be impacted.IMPORTANCE Biofilms are an important mode of growth in many settings. Here, we looked at small differences in the genomes of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes isolate EGDe and used them to find out how biofilms form. This important fundamental information may help new treatments to be developed and also highlights the fact that isolates of the same identity often diverge.},

Seven different regulators of sigma B (Rsbs) are located in the sigB operons of both Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes. In B. subtilis, these proteins contribute to regulation of σB activity by conveying environmental and energy stress signals through two well-established branches of a signal transduction pathway. RsbT contributes to regulation of σB activity in response to environmental stresses, while RsbV contributes to σB activation under both environmental and energy stresses in B. subtilis. To probe L. monocytogenes Rsb roles in σB-mediated responses to various stresses, in-frame deletions were created in rsbT and rsbV. Phenotypic characterization of the L. monocytogenes rsbT and rsbV null mutants revealed that both mutants were similar to the ΔsigB strain in their abilities to survive under environmental stress conditions (exposure to synthetic gastric fluid, pH 2.5, acidified brain heart infusion broth [BHI], or oxidative stress [13 mM cumene hydroperoxide]). Under energy stress conditions (carbon starvation in defined media, entry into stationary phase, or reduced intracellular ATP), both ΔrsbT and ΔrsbV showed survival reductions similar to that of the ΔsigB strain. These observations suggest that the pathways for Rsb-dependent regulation of σB activity differ between L. monocytogenes and B. subtilis. As σB also activates transcription of the L. monocytogenes prfAP2 promoter, we evaluated virulence-associated characteristics of ΔprfAP1rsbT and ΔprfAP1rsbV double mutants in hemolysis and tissue culture assays. Both double mutants showed identical phenotypes to ΔprfAP1P2 and ΔprfAP1sigB double mutants, i.e., reduced hemolysis activity and reduced plaque size in mouse fibroblast cells. These findings indicate that RsbT and RsbV both contribute to σB activation in L. monocytogenes during exposure to environmental and energy stresses as well as during tissue culture infection.},

	abstract = {The general stress regulon of Bacillus subtilis is controlled by σB, a transcription factor that is activated by physical or nutritional stress. In B. subtilis, each of these two stresses is communicated to the primary σB regulators by distinct pathways. Physical stress activation of σB involves a large-molecular-mass ({\textgreater}106-Da) structure (stressosome) formed by one or more homologous proteins (RsbRA, -B, -C, and -D) onto which the pathway's principal regulators are bound. The RsbR proteins are thought to be potential receptors for stress signaling. Listeria monocytogenes encodes orthologs of σB and its principal regulators; however, unlike B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes appears to use the stressosome pathway for both physical and nutritional stress activation of σB. In the current work, a B. subtilis strain that expressed L. monocytogenes rsbR (rsbRLm ) in lieu of B. subtilis rsbR (rsbRBs ) was created and was found to display the Listeria phenotype of σB activation following exposure to either physical or nutritional stress. B. subtilis expressing either the RsbR paralog rsbRC or rsbRD, but not rsbRA or rsbRB, as the sole source of RsbR also allowed σB induction following nutritional stress. It is unclear whether the nutritional stress induction seen in these strains is the result of a direct effect of nutritional stress on stressosome activity or a consequence of the background levels of σB activation in these strains and the effects of diminished ATP on the downstream phosphorylation reaction needed to reinactivate σB.},

Transcription of the 0.4 kb gene is turned on at the onset of sporulation; this RNA synthesis depends on the products of the B. subtilis regulatory genes (the spoO loci) that control the initiation of development. Recognition of the 0.4 kb gene promoter in vitro is dictated by novel species of B. subtilis RNA polymerase sigma factor known as sigma 37 and sigma 29 but not by the principal B. subtilis sigma factor sigma 55. Using S1 nuclease mapping, runoff transcription and dinucleotide priming, we have identified dual startpoints (separated by about 10 bp) for sigma37-directed transcription of the 0.4 kb gene These start-points correspond closely to the 5' termini of 0.4 kb RNA synthesized in vivo during the course of sporulation. Two forms of sigma37 containing RNA polymerase were distinguished that preferentially utilize either the upstream or the downstream startpoint in vitro. We investigated the requirements for sigma37-directed transcription by constructing in vitro deletion mutations that extend from the upstream direction into the 0.4 kb promoter region. One such deletion, which terminates 40 and 51 bp upstream from the transcription startpoints (thereby removing a highly AT-rich 26 bp sequence), completely eliminates transcription from the downstream startpoint but only partially inhibits transcription from the upstream startpoint. A second deletion that terminates at the upstream startpoint completely prevents transcription from both initiation sites. The implications of 0.4 kb gene promoter structure for developmentally regulated transcription of B, subtilis are discussed.},

	abstract = {The general stress response of Bacillus subtilis is controlled by the ςB transcription factor, which is activated in response to diverse energy and environmental stresses. These two classes of stress are transmitted by separate signaling pathways which converge on the direct regulators of ςB, the RsbV anti-anti-ς factor and the RsbW anti-ς factor. The energy signaling branch involves the RsbP phosphatase, which dephosphorylates RsbV in order to trigger the general stress response. The rsbP structural gene lies downstream from rsbQ in a two-gene operon. Here we identify the RsbQ protein as a required positive regulator inferred to act in concert with the RsbP phosphatase. RsbQ bound RsbP in the yeast two-hybrid system, and a large in-frame deletion in rsbQ had the same phenotype as a null allele of rsbP—an inability to activate ςB in response to energy stress. Genetic complementation studies indicated that this phenotype was not due to a polar effect of the rsbQ alteration on rsbP. The predicted rsbQ product is a hydrolase or acyltransferase of the α/β fold superfamily, members of which catalyze a wide variety of reactions. Notably, substitutions in the presumed catalytic triad of RsbQ also abolished the energy stress response but had no detectable effect on RsbQ structure, synthesis, or stability. We conclude that the catalytic activity of RsbQ is an essential constituent of the energy stress signaling pathway.},

In bacteria, four families of energy-dependent proteases carry out degradation. In all of them, substrates are first recognized and bound by ATPase domains and then unfolded and translocated to a sequestered proteolytic chamber. Substrate selection depends not on ubiquitin but on intrinsic recognition signals within the proteins and, in some cases, on adaptor or effector proteins that participate in delivering the substrate to the protease. For some, the activity of these adaptors can be regulated, which results in regulated proteolysis. Recognition motifs for proteolysis are frequently found at the N and C termini of substrates. Proteolytic switches appear to be critical for cell cycle development in Caulobacter crescentus, for proper sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, and for the transition in and out of stationary phase in Escherichia coli. In eukaryotes, the same proteases are found in organelles, where they also play important roles.},

	abstract = {Many common metabolites are intrinsically unstable and reactive, and hence prone to chemical (i.e. non-enzymatic) damage in vivo Although this fact is widely recognized, the purely chemical side-reactions of metabolic intermediates can be surprisingly hard to track down in the literature and are often treated in an unprioritized case-by-case way. Moreover, spontaneous chemical side-reactions tend to be overshadowed today by side-reactions mediated by promiscuous ('sloppy') enzymes even though chemical damage to metabolites may be even more prevalent than damage from enzyme sloppiness, has similar outcomes, and is held in check by similar biochemical repair or pre-emption mechanisms. To address these limitations and imbalances, here we draw together and systematically integrate information from the (bio)chemical literature, from cheminformatics, and from genome-scale metabolic models to objectively define a 'Top 30' list of damage-prone metabolites. A foundational part of this process was to derive general reaction rules for the damage chemistries involved. The criteria for a 'Top 30' metabolite included predicted chemical reactivity, essentiality, and occurrence in diverse organisms. We also explain how the damage chemistry reaction rules ('operators') are implemented in the Chemical-Damage-MINE (CD-MINE) database (minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov/\#/top30) to provide a predictive tool for many additional potential metabolite damage products. Lastly, we illustrate how defining a 'Top 30' list can drive genomics-enabled discovery of the enzymes of previously unrecognized damage-control systems, and how applying chemical damage reaction rules can help identify previously unknown peaks in metabolomics profiles.},

We have previously shown that four genes (bshA, bshB1, bshB2 and bshC) are involved in bacillithiol biosynthesis. Here, we report that these four genes are encoded within three, unlinked operons all expressed from canonical σ(A)-dependent promoters as determined by 5'RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The bshA and bshB1 genes are embedded within a seven-gene operon additionally including mgsA, encoding methylglyoxal synthase, and the essential genes cca and birA, encoding tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA transferase) and biotin-protein ligase, respectively. The bshB2 gene is co-transcribed with unknown function genes, while bshC is expressed both as part of a two-gene operon (with the upstream putative pantothenate biosynthesis gene ylbQ) and from its own promoter. All three operons are expressed at a reduced level in an spx null mutant, consistent with a direct role of Spx as a transcriptional activator for these operons, and all three operons are induced by the thiol oxidant diamide. In contrast with other Spx-regulated genes characterized to date, the effects of Spx on basal expression and diamide-stimulated expression appear to be independent of Cys10 in the redox centre of Spx. Consistent with the role of Spx as an activator of bacillithiol biosynthetic genes, cellular levels of bacillithiol are reduced several-fold in an spx null mutant.},

Most studies of the evolution of new pathways have focused on the origins and quality of function of the enzymes involved. However, there is an additional layer of complexity that has received less attention. Introduction of a novel pathway into an existing metabolic network can result in inhibitory cross-talk due to adventitious interactions between metabolites and macromolecules that have not previously encountered one another. Here, we report a thorough examination of inhibitory cross-talk between a novel metabolic pathway for synthesis of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and the existing metabolic network of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate multiple problematic interactions, including (i) interference by metabolites in the novel pathway with metabolic processes in the existing network, (ii) interference by metabolites in the existing network with the function of the novel pathway, and (iii) diversion of metabolites from the novel pathway by promiscuous activities of enzymes in the existing metabolic network. Identification of the mechanisms of inhibitory cross-talk can reveal the types of adaptations that must occur to enhance the performance of a novel metabolic pathway as well as the fitness of the microbial host. These findings have important implications for evolutionary studies of the emergence of novel pathways in nature as well as genetic engineering of microbes for “green” manufacturing processes.},

ClpP is also essential for intracellular protein quality control, and in its absence newly synthesized proteins were highly prone to aggregation even at 37°C. Proteomic comparisons between the wild type and a ΔclpP mutant showed that the absence of ClpP leads to severe perturbations of “normal” physiology, complicating the detection of ClpP substrates. A pulse-chase two-dimensional gel approach was therefore used to compare wild-type and clpP mutant cultures that had been radiolabeled in mid-exponential phase, by quantifying changes in relative spot intensities with time. The results showed that overall proteolysis is biased toward proteins with vegetative functions which are no longer required (or are required at lower levels) in the nongrowing state. The identified substrate candidates for ClpP-dependent degradation include metabolic enzymes and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Some substrate candidates catalyze the first committed step of certain biosynthetic pathways. Our data suggest that ClpP-dependent proteolysis spans a broad physiological spectrum, with regulatory processing of key metabolic components and regulatory proteins on the one side and general bulk protein breakdown at the transition from growing to nongrowing phases on the other.},

Approximately 200 protein spots diminished in the wild-type cells during an 8-h time course. The degradation rate of at least 80 proteins was significantly reduced in clpP, clpC, and clpX mutant strains. Enzymes of amino acid and nucleotide metabolism were overrepresented among these Clp substrate candidates. Notably, several first-committed-step enzymes for biosynthesis of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, cell wall precursors, purines, and pyrimidines appeared as putative Clp substrates. Radioimmunoprecipitation demonstrated GlmS, IlvB, PurF, and PyrB to be novel ClpCP targets. Our data imply that Clp proteases down-regulate central metabolic pathways upon entry into a nongrowing state and thus contribute to the adaptation to nutrient starvation.

The S-box riboswitch, found primarily in low-G+C gram-positive bacteria, is the paradigm for riboswitches that sense S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Genes in the S-box family are involved in methionine metabolism, and their expression is induced in response to starvation for methionine. S-box genes exhibit conserved primary sequence and secondary structural elements in their leader regions. We previously demonstrated that SAM binds directly to S-box leader RNA, causing a structural rearrangement that results in premature termination of transcription at S-box leader region terminators. S-box genes have a variety of physiological roles, and natural variability in S-box structure and regulatory response could provide additional insight into the role of conserved S-box leader elements in SAM-directed transcription termination. In the current study, in vivo and in vitro assays were employed to analyze the differential regulation of S-box genes in response to SAM. A wide range of responses to SAM were observed for the 11 S-box-regulated transcriptional units in Bacillus subtilis, demonstrating that S-box riboswitches can be calibrated to different physiological requirements.},

	abstract = {Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the metabolically active form of vitamin B6, plays an essential role in brain metabolism as a cofactor in numerous enzyme reactions. PLP deficiency in brain, either genetic or acquired, results in severe drug-resistant seizures that respond to vitamin B6 supplementation. The pathogenesis of vitamin B6 deficiency is largely unknown. To shed more light on the metabolic consequences of vitamin B6 deficiency in brain, we performed untargeted metabolomics in vitamin B6-deprived Neuro-2a cells. Significant alterations were observed in a range of metabolites. The most surprising observation was a decrease of serine and glycine, two amino acids that are known to be elevated in the plasma of vitamin B6 deficient patients. To investigate the cause of the low concentrations of serine and glycine, a metabolic flux analysis on serine biosynthesis was performed. The metabolic flux results showed that the de novo synthesis of serine was significantly reduced in vitamin B6-deprived cells. In addition, formation of glycine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was decreased. Thus, vitamin B6 is essential for serine de novo biosynthesis in neuronal cells, and serine de novo synthesis is critical to maintain intracellular serine and glycine. These findings suggest that serine and glycine concentrations in brain may be deficient in patients with vitamin B6 responsive epilepsy. The low intracellular 5-mTHF concentrations observed in vitro may explain the favourable but so far unexplained response of some patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy to folinic acid supplementation.},

              None of the enzymes encoded by these genes has a promiscuous 4-phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase activity that can replace the activity of PdxB.
            
            
              Overexpression of these genes restores PLP synthesis by three different serendipitous pathways that feed into the normal PLP synthesis pathway downstream of the blocked step.
            
            
              Reactions in one of these pathways are catalyzed by low-level activities of enzymes of unknown function and a promiscuous activity of an enzyme that normally has a role in another pathway; one reaction appears to be non-enzymatic.
            
          
        , Most metabolic enzymes are prodigious catalysts that have evolved to accelerate chemical reactions with high efficiency and specificity. However, many enzymes have inefficient promiscuous activities, as well, as a result of the assemblage of highly reactive catalytic residues and cofactors in active sites. Although promiscuous activities are generally orders of magnitude less efficient than well-evolved activities (, ; ; ), they often enhance reaction rates by orders of magnitude relative to those of uncatalyzed reactions (, ). Thus, promiscuous activities provide a reservoir of novel catalytic activities that can be recruited to serve new functions., The evolutionary potential of promiscuous enzymes extends beyond the recruitment of single enzymes to serve new functions. Microbes contain hundreds of enzymes—E. coli contains about 1700 ()—raising the possibility that promiscuous enzymes can be patched together to generate ‘serendipitous' pathways that are not part of normal metabolism. We distinguish serendipitous pathways from latent or cryptic pathways, which are bona fide pathways involving dedicated enzymes that are produced only under particular environmental circumstances. In contrast, serendipitous pathways are patched together from enzymes that normally serve other functions and are not regulated in a coordinated manner in response to the need to synthesize or degrade a metabolite., In this study, we describe the discovery of three serendipitous pathways that allow synthesis of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in a strain of E. coli that lacks 4-phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase (PdxB) when one of the seven different genes is overexpressed. These genes were identified in a multicopy suppression experiment in which a library of E. coli genes (from the ASKA collection) was introduced into a ΔpdxB strain of E. coli that is unable to synthesize PLP. Surprisingly, none of the enzymes encoded by these genes has a promiscuous 4-phosphoerythronate (4PE) dehydrogenase activity that can substitute for the missing PdxB. Rather, overproduction of these enzymes appears to facilitate at least three serendipitous pathways that draw material from other metabolic pathways and feed into the normal PLP synthesis pathway downstream of the blocked step ()., We have characterized one of these pathways in detail (). The first step, dephosphorylation of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, is catalyzed by YeaB, a predicted NUDIX hydrolase of unknown function. Although catalysis is inefficient (kcat=5.7×10−5 s−1 and kcat/KM{\textgreater}0.028 M−1 s−1), the enzymatic rate is 4×107-fold faster than the rate of the uncatalyzed reaction, and is sufficient to support PLP synthesis when YeaB is overproduced. The second step in the pathway is decarboxylation of 3-hydroxypyruvate (3HP). Although we found two enzymes (1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase and the catalytic domain of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) that catalyze this reaction with low but respectable activity in vitro, their involvement in pathway 1 was ruled out by genetic methods. Surprisingly, the non-enzymatic rate of decarboxylation of 3HP appears to be sufficient to support PLP synthesis. The third step in the pathway, condensation of glycolaldehyde and glycine to form 4-hydroxy-L-threonine, is catalyzed by LtaE, a low-specificity threonine aldolase whose physiological role is not known. The final step, phosphorylation of 4-hydroxy-L-threonine, is catalyzed by homoserine kinase (ThrB), which is required for synthesis of threonine. The promiscuous phosphorylation of 4-hydroxy-L-threonine is 80-fold slower than the physiological phosphorylation of homoserine. The involvement of LtaE and ThrB in pathway 1 was confirmed by genetic experiments showing that overexpression of yeaB no longer restores growth of ΔpdxB strains lacking either ltaE or thrB., Although pathway 1 is inefficient, it provides the ΔpdxB strain with the ability to grow under conditions in which survival is otherwise impossible. In general, serendipitous assembly of an inefficient pathway from promiscuous activities of available enzymes will be important whenever the pathway provides increased fitness. This might occur when a critical metabolite is no longer available from the environment, and survival depends on assembly of a new biosynthetic pathway. A second circumstance in which an inefficient serendipitous pathway might improve fitness is the appearance of a novel compound in the environment that can be exploited as a source of carbon, nitrogen or phosphorous. Finally, chemotherapeutic agents that block metabolic pathways in bacteria or cancer cells could provide selective pressure for assembly of serendipitous pathways that allow synthesis of the end product of the blocked pathway and thus a previously unappreciated source of drug resistance. In all of these cases, even an inefficient pathway can provide a selective advantage over other cells in a particular environmental niche, allowing survival and subsequent mutations that elevate the efficiency of the pathway., Our work is consistent with the hypothesis that the recognized metabolic network of E. coli is underlain by a denser network of reactions due to promiscuous enzymes that use and generate recognized metabolites, but also unusual metabolites that normally have no physiological role. The findings reported here highlight the abundance of cryptic capabilities in the E. coli proteome that can be drawn on to generate novel pathways. Such pathways could provide a starting place for assembly of more efficient pathways, both in nature and in the hands of metabolic engineers., Bacterial genomes encode hundreds to thousands of enzymes, most of which are specialized for particular functions. However, most enzymes have inefficient promiscuous activities, as well, that generally serve no purpose. Promiscuous reactions can be patched together to form multistep metabolic pathways. Mutations that increase expression or activity of enzymes in such serendipitous pathways can elevate flux through the pathway to a physiologically significant level. In this study, we describe the discovery of three serendipitous pathways that allow synthesis of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) in a strain of E. coli that lacks 4-phosphoerythronate (4PE) dehydrogenase (PdxB) when one of seven different genes is overexpressed. We have characterized one of these pathways in detail. This pathway diverts material from serine biosynthesis and generates an intermediate in the normal PLP synthesis pathway downstream of the block caused by lack of PdxB. Steps in the pathway are catalyzed by a protein of unknown function, a broad-specificity enzyme whose physiological role is unknown, and a promiscuous activity of an enzyme that normally serves another function. One step in the pathway may be non-enzymatic.},

Three broad considerations suggest that bacterial shapes are not accidental but are biologically important: cells adopt uniform morphologies from among a wide variety of possibilities, some cells modify their shape as conditions demand, and morphology can be tracked through evolutionary lineages. All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live. Just as we are beginning to answer how bacteria create their shapes, it seems reasonable and essential that we expand our efforts to understand why they do so.},

Examples are presented in which underground metabolism of this sort produces an observable phenotype. Although biological processes can be remarkably accurate, evolution has selected error rates far from perfect. It is suggested here that a certain level of metabolic inaccuracy, in addition to saving energy, may also confer an evolutionary advantage, for example by providing metabolic plasticity. Since underground reactions are unpredictable from DNA sequence data, caution is in order when interpreting correlations between genetic disorders and pathological syndromes.},

Recent experimental evidence suggests that promiscuity, not only in interactions but also in the actual function of proteins, is not as rare as was previously thought. This has implications not only for our fundamental understanding of molecular recognition and how protein function has evolved over time but also in the realm of biotechnology. Understanding protein promiscuity is becoming increasingly important not only to optimize protein engineering applications in areas as diverse as synthetic biology and metagenomics but also to lower attrition rates in drug discovery programs, identify drug interaction surfaces less susceptible to escape mutations and potentiate the power of polypharmacology.},

The ndh gene regulates expression of the yjlC-ndh operon, as indicated by the fact that mutation in ndh causes a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio. An in vitro study showed that Rex binds to the downstream region of the yjlC-ndh promoter and that NAD+ enhances the binding of Rex to the putative Rex-binding sites in the yjlC-ndh operon as well as in the cydABCD operon.

Without crescentin, the cells adopt a straight-rod morphology. Crescentin has characteristic features of IF proteins including the ability to assemble into filaments in vitro without energy or cofactor requirements. In vivo, crescentin forms a helical structure that colocalizes with the inner cell curvatures beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. We propose that IF-like filaments of crescentin assemble into a helical structure, which by applying its geometry to the cell, generates a vibrioid or helical cell shape depending on the length of the cell.},

De novo biosynthesis of the vitamin has been described relatively recently and is derived from simple sugar precursors as well as glutamine. In addition, the vitamin can be taken up from exogenous sources in a broad range of organisms, including plants. However, specific transporters have been identified only in yeast. Here we assess the ability of the family of Arabidopsis purine permeases (PUPs) to transport vitamin B6. Several members of the family complement the growth phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain impaired in both de novo biosynthesis of vitamin B6 as well as its uptake. The strongest activity was observed with PUP1 and was confirmed by direct measurement of uptake in yeast as well as in planta, defining PUP1 as a high affinity transporter for pyridoxine. At the tissue level the protein is localised to hydathodes and here we use confocal microscopy to illustrate that at the cellular level it is targeted to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we observe alterations in pyridoxine recycling from the guttation sap upon overexpression of PUP1 and in a pup1 mutant, consistent with the role of the protein in retrieval of pyridoxine. Furthermore, combining the pup1 mutant with a vitamin B6 de novo biosynthesis mutant (pdx1.3) corroborates that PUP1 is involved in the uptake of the vitamin.},

PN, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine are collectively referred to as vitamin B6, and mammalian organisms depend on its uptake from the diet. In addition to the ability to use extracellular vitamin B6, most unicellular organisms are also capable of synthesizing PN to generate pyridoxal phosphate. Here, we report the isolation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that have lost the ability to transport PN across the plasma membrane. We used these mutants to isolate TPN1, the first known gene encoding a transport protein for vitamin B6. Tpn1p is a member of the purine-cytosine permease family within the major facilitator superfamily. The protein functions as a proton symporter, localizes to the plasma membrane, and has high affinity for PN. TPN1 mutants lost the ability to utilize extracellular PN, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, showing that there is no other transporter for vitamin B6 encoded in the genome. Amino acid substitutions that led to a loss of Tpn1p function localized to transmembrane domain 4 within the 12-transmembrane domain protein. Moreover, expression of TPN1 was regulated and increased with decreasing concentrations of vitamin B6 in the medium. We also provide evidence that of the highly conserved SNZ and SNO genes in S. cerevisiae, only the protein encoded by SNZ1 is required for vitamin B6 biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis sporulation is an adaptive response to nutritional stress and involves the differential development of two cells. In the last 10 years or so, virtually all of the regulatory genes controlling sporulation, and many genes directing the structural and morphological changes that accompany sporulation, have been cloned and characterized. This review describes our current knowledge of the program of gene expression during sporulation and summarizes what is known about the functions of the genes that determine the specialized biochemical and morphological properties of sporulating cells. Most steps in the genetic program are controlled by transcription factors that have been characterized in vitro. Two sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma E and sigma F, appear to segregate at septation, effectively determining the differential development of the mother cell and prespore. Later, each sigma is replaced by a second cell-specific sigma factor, sigma K in the mother cell and sigma G in the prespore. The synthesis of each sigma factor is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Usually this regulation involves an intercellular interaction that coordinates the developmental programmes of the two cells. At least two other transcription factors fine tune the timing and levels of expression of genes in the sigma E and sigma K regulons. The controlled synthesis of the sigma factors and other transcription factors leads to a spatially and temporally ordered program of gene expression. The gene products made during each successive stage of sporulation help to bring about a sequence of gross morphological changes and biochemical adaptations. The formation of the asymmetric spore septum, engulfment of the prespore by the mother cell, and formation of the spore core, cortex, and coat are described. The importance of these structures in the development of the resistance, dormancy, and germination properties of the spore is assessed.},

Therefore, vitamin B6 is a valuable compound for the pharmaceutical and the food industry. Although vitamin B6 is currently chemically synthesized, there is considerable interest on the industrial side to shift from chemical processes to sustainable fermentation technologies. Here, we review recent findings regarding biosynthesis and homeostasis of vitamin B6 and describe the approaches that have been made in the past to develop microbial production processes.

Due to limited and somewhat inconsistent data together with the ample variety of critical functions in which vitamin B6 is involved in the human body, it is very challenging to attempt at establishing a cause and effect relationship between vitamin B6 and risk of cardiovascular disease as it is to delineate the exact mechanism(s) by which vitamin B6 may modulate such risk. In the present chapter we review the currently available knowledge deriving from both epidemiological and mechanistic studies designed to define potential candidate mechanisms for the association of vitamin B6 impairment and risk of cardiovascular disease development.},

After starting pyridoxine supplementation, improvement in the EEG for a 24-hour period was seen. We decided to look at the pyridoxine levels in adult patients admitted with status epilepticus. We reviewed the records on patients admitted to the neurological ICU for status epilepticus (SE). Eighty-one adult patients were identified with documented pyridoxine levels. For comparison purposes, we looked at pyridoxine levels in outpatients with epilepsy (n=132). Reported normal pyridoxine range is {\textgreater}10ng/mL. All but six patients admitted for SE had low normal or undetectable pyridoxine levels. A selective pyridoxine deficiency was seen in 94\% of patients with status epilepticus (compared to 39.4\% in the outpatients) which leads us to believe that there is a relationship between status epilepticus and pyridoxine levels.},

	abstract = {Earlier (Section 8.1.1), we considered the fact that many enzymes re- quire cofactors to be catalytically active. One class of these cofactors, termed coenzymes, consists of small organic molecules, many of which are derived from vitamins. Vitamins themselves are organic molecules that are needed in small amounts in the diets of some higher animals. These molecules serve the same roles in nearly all forms of life, but higher animals lost the capacity to synthesize them in the course of evolution. For instance, whereas E. coli can thrive on glucose and organic salts, human beings require at least 12 vitamins in the diet. The biosynthetic pathways for vitamins can be complex; thus, it is biologically more efficient to ingest vitamins than to synthesize the enzymes required to construct them from simple molecules. This efficiency comes at the cost of dependence on other organisms for chemicals essential for life. Indeed, vitamin deficiency can generate diseases in all organisms requiring these molecules (Tables 8.9 and 8.10). Vitamins can be grouped according to whether they are soluble in water or in nonpolar solvents.},

	abstract = {Vitamin B6 requirements of patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis. Patients with chronic renal failure often develop vitamin B6 deficiency, which is of clinical concern because the multiorgan system manifestations are similar to those of uremia. Vitamin B6 deficiency in hemodialysis patients has been previously studied, but the need for daily pyridoxine supplementation in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) remains unclear. Therefore, we studied a group of 11 stable patients, nine on CAPD and two CCPD, to test for vitamin B6 deficiency and to establish daily requirements. Adequacy of vitamin B6 nutrition was assessed by measurement of plasma and dialysate effluent total vitamin B6 and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the latter using a very sensitive modification of the tyrosine apodecarboxylase enzyme assay. After four weeks without vitamin B6 supplements on a diet containing 1.3 ± 0.2mg vitamin B6/day (7.7 ± 1.2 µmol/day), all patients had subnormal plasma PLP levels, 16 ± 3nmol/liter (nml 40 to 60), seven having a severe deficiency (≤20nmol/liter). Plasma total vitamin B6 levels (which includes non-PLP forms of the vitamin) were normal in all patients at baseline, 116 ± 29nmol/liter. Peritoneal losses were small, 8 ± 2nmol PLP/day and 545 ± 61nmol total vitamin B6/day. Supplementation with 5mg/day oral pyridoxine HCl for up to 16 weeks adequately repleted eight patients (65 ± 7nmol PLP/L), while three patients required 10mg/day to achieve normal plasma PLP levels. During three episodes of peritonitis, dialysate losses of PLP did not increase. These data indicate that in these CPD patients: (1) dietary intake of vitamin B6 is inadequate to prevent significant deficiency; (2) low plasma PLP levels may be caused by impaired phosphorylation of precursor forms or increased degradation of PLP, not by the negligible losses into peritoneal dialysate; and (3) 10mg of daily oral pyridoxine hydrochloride supplementation restores plasma PLP levels to normal and is the recommended dose for these patients.},

Purified GabR bound specifically to the DNA region overlapping the -35 region of the gabT promoter and the -10 and +1 regions of the gabR promoter. Two 6 bp direct repeats located at the ends of this region appeared to be essential for GabR binding. In transcription reactions in vitro, GabR alone repressed expression from the gabR promoter but activated expression from the gabT promoter only in the presence of GABA and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, an essential cofactor of aminotransferases. A similar requirement for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and GABA for GabR-mediated transcription activation was shown in vivo. In vitro this requirement could be partially satisfied with pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate and succinic semialdehyde, the products of a GABA-dependent aminotransferase half-reaction. We hypothesize that the GabR-catalyzed aminotransferase-like reaction between GABA and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is essential for GabR action as a transcriptional activator.},

In this study, we characterized the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis pathway in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our results revealed that S. pneumoniae possesses a de novo vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway encoded by the pdxST genes. Purified PdxS functionally displayed as PLP synthase, whereas PdxT exhibited glutaminase activity in vitro. Deletion of pdxS, but not pdxT, resulted in a vitamin B6 auxotrophic mutant. The defective growth of the ΔpdxS mutant in a vitamin B6-depleted medium could be chemically restored in the presence of the B6 vitamers at optimal concentrations. By analyzing PdxS expression levels, we demonstrated that the expression of pdxS was repressed by PLP and activated by a transcription factor, PdxR. A pneumococcal ΔpdxR mutant also exhibited as a vitamin B6 auxotroph. In addition, we found that disruption of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway in S. pneumoniae caused a significant attenuation in a chinchilla middle ear infection model and a minor attenuation in a mouse pneumonia model, indicating that the impact of vitamin B6 synthesis on virulence depends upon the bacterial infection niche.},

The vitamin is also implicated in numerous human body functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to its recent discovery as a potent antioxidant. Its de novo biosynthesis occurs only in bacteria, fungi and plants, making it an essential nutrient in the human diet. Despite its paramount importance, its biosynthesis was predominantly investigated in Escherichia coli, where it is synthesized from the condensation of deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate and 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine catalysed by the concerted action of PdxA and PdxJ. However, it has now become clear that the majority of organisms capable of producing this vitamin do so via a different route, involving precursors from glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. This alternative pathway is characterized by the presence of two genes, Pdx1 and Pdx2. Their discovery has sparked renewed interest in vitamin B6, and numerous studies have been conducted over the last few years to characterize the new biosynthesis pathway. Indeed, enormous progress has been made in defining the nature of the enzymes involved in both pathways, and important insights have been provided into their mechanisms of action. In the present review, we summarize the recent advances in our knowledge of the biosynthesis of this versatile molecule and compare the two independent routes to the biosynthesis of vitamin B6. Surprisingly, this comparison reveals that the key biosynthetic enzymes of both pathways are, in fact, very similar both structurally and mechanistically.},

As with C. sinensis, Opisthorchis spp. and Dicrocoelium spp., they affect millions of people worldwide, causing severe health problems. Collectively, the group is referred to as the Food-Borne Trematodes and their true significance is now being more widely recognised. However, reports of resistance to triclabendazole (TCBZ), the most widely used anti-Fasciola drug, and to other current drugs are increasing. This is a worrying scenario. In this review, progress in understanding the mechanism(s) of resistance to TCBZ is discussed, focusing on tubulin mutations, altered drug uptake and changes in drug metabolism. There is much interest in the development of new drugs and drug combinations, the re-purposing of non-flukicidal drugs, and the development of new drug formulations and delivery systems; all this work will be reviewed. Sound farm management practices also need to be put in place, with effective treatment programmes, so that drugs can be used wisely and their efficacy conserved as much as is possible. This depends on reliable advice being given by veterinarians and other advisors. Accurate diagnosis and identification of drug-resistant fluke populations is central to effective control: to determine the actual extent of the problem and to determine how well or otherwise a treatment has worked; for research on establishing the mechanism of resistance (and identifying molecular markers of resistance); for informing treatment options; and for testing the efficacy of new drug candidates.

	abstract = {Clonorchis sinensis (family Opisthorchiidae) is an important foodborne parasite that has a major socioeconomic impact on {\textasciitilde}35 million people predominantly in China, Vietnam, Korea and the Russian Far East. In humans, infection with C. sinensis causes clonorchiasis, a complex hepatobiliary disease that can induce cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignant cancer of the bile ducts. Central to understanding the epidemiology of this disease is knowledge of genetic variation within and among populations of this parasite. Although most published molecular studies seem to suggest that C. sinensis represents a single species, evidence of karyotypic variation within C. sinensis and cryptic species within a related opisthorchiid fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini) emphasise the importance of studying and comparing the genes and genomes of geographically distinct isolates of C. sinensis. Recently, we sequenced, assembled and characterised a draft nuclear genome of a C. sinensis isolate from Korea and compared it with a published draft genome of a Chinese isolate of this species using a bioinformatic workflow established for comparing draft genome assemblies and their gene annotations. We identified that 50.6\% and 51.3\% of the Korean and Chinese C. sinensis genomic scaffolds were syntenic, respectively. Within aligned syntenic blocks, the genomes had a high level of nucleotide identity (99.1\%) and encoded 15 variable proteins likely to be involved in diverse biological processes. Here, we review current technical challenges of using draft genome assemblies to undertake comparative genomic analyses to quantify genetic variation between isolates of the same species. Using a workflow that overcomes these challenges, we report on a high-quality draft genome for C. sinensis from Korea and comparative genomic analyses, as a basis for future investigations of the genetic structures of C. sinensis populations, and discuss the biotechnological implications of these explorations.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of Homo sapiens has a pivotal role to play in the macro and microepidemiology of emerging or re-emerging parasitic zoonoses. Changing demographics and the concomitant alterations to the environment, climate, technology, land use and changes in human behavior, converge to favour the emergence and spread of parasitic zoonoses. The recent unprecedented movements of people, their animals and their parasites around the world, introduce and mix genes, cultural preferences, customs, and behavioral patterns. The increasing proclivity for eating meat, fish, crabs, shrimp, molluscs raw, undercooked, smoked, pickled or dried facilitates a number of protozoan (Toxoplasma), trematode (Fasciola sp., Paragonimus spp., Clonorchis sp., Opisthorchis spp., Heterophyes sp., Metagonimus sp., Echinostoma spp., Nanophyetus sp.) cestode (Taenia spp, Diphyllobothrum sp.) and nematode (Trichinella spp., Capillaria spp., Gnathostoma spp., Anisakis sp., Parastrongylus spp.) caused zoonoses. The increasing world population and the inability to keep pace with the provision of adequate sanitation and clean, safe drinking water, has led to an increased importance of waterborne zoonoses, such as those caused by Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma. Our close relationship with and the numerous uses to which we put companion animals and their ubiquitous distribution has resulted in dogs and cats unwitting participation in sharing over 60 parasite species including: Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, most foodborne trematode species, Diphyllobothrum, Echinococcus spp., Ancylostoma and Toxocara. Changing human behaviour through education, to encourage the proper cooking of food, which may have cultural and social significance, will remain as challenging as controlling stray and feral pet populations, improving hygiene levels and the provision of safe drinking water and the proper use of sanctuary facilities. Long pre-patent periods and the normally insidious sub-clinical nature of most zoonoses makes advice requiring behavioural change for their control a difficult task. Our clearer understanding of the heterogeneity of susceptibility to infection, the complex genetic variations of people and parasite species and the development of molecular epidemiological tools is shedding more light on transmission routes and the spectrum of disease that is observed. Improved and new serological, molecular and imaging diagnostic tests and the development of broad spectrum chemotherapeutic agents has led to the attenuation of morbidity and mortality due to parasitic zoonoses in economically advantaged regions. Such advancements, in partnership with supportive behavioural change, has the potential for a sustainable global reduction in the burden of ill health due to parasitic zoonoses. Whether this will materialise is a challenge for us all.},

	abstract = {The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foodborne diseases are globally important, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Parasitic diseases often result in high burdens of disease in low and middle income countries and are frequently transmitted to humans via contaminated food. This study presents the first estimates of the global and regional human disease burden of 10 helminth diseases and toxoplasmosis that may be attributed to contaminated food.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were abstracted from 16 systematic reviews or similar studies published between 2010 and 2015; from 5 disease data bases accessed in 2015; and from 79 reports, 73 of which have been published since 2000, 4 published between 1995 and 2000 and 2 published in 1986 and 1981. These included reports from national surveillance systems, journal articles, and national estimates of foodborne diseases. These data were used to estimate the number of infections, sequelae, deaths, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), by age and region for 2010. These parasitic diseases, resulted in 48.4 million cases (95\% Uncertainty intervals [UI] of 43.4-79.0 million) and 59,724 (95\% UI 48,017-83,616) deaths annually resulting in 8.78 million (95\% UI 7.62-12.51 million) DALYs. We estimated that 48\% (95\% UI 38\%-56\%) of cases of these parasitic diseases were foodborne, resulting in 76\% (95\% UI 65\%-81\%) of the DALYs attributable to these diseases. Overall, foodborne parasitic disease, excluding enteric protozoa, caused an estimated 23.2 million (95\% UI 18.2-38.1 million) cases and 45,927 (95\% UI 34,763-59,933) deaths annually resulting in an estimated 6.64 million (95\% UI 5.61-8.41 million) DALYs. Foodborne Ascaris infection (12.3 million cases, 95\% UI 8.29-22.0 million) and foodborne toxoplasmosis (10.3 million cases, 95\% UI 7.40-14.9 million) were the most common foodborne parasitic diseases. Human cysticercosis with 2.78 million DALYs (95\% UI 2.14-3.61 million), foodborne trematodosis with 2.02 million DALYs (95\% UI 1.65-2.48 million) and foodborne toxoplasmosis with 825,000 DALYs (95\% UI 561,000-1.26 million) resulted in the highest burdens in terms of DALYs, mainly due to years lived with disability. Foodborne enteric protozoa, reported elsewhere, resulted in an additional 67.2 million illnesses or 492,000 DALYs. Major limitations of our study include often substantial data gaps that had to be filled by imputation and suffer from the uncertainties that surround such models. Due to resource limitations it was also not possible to consider all potentially foodborne parasites (for example Trypanosoma cruzi).
CONCLUSIONS: Parasites are frequently transmitted to humans through contaminated food. These estimates represent an important step forward in understanding the impact of foodborne diseases globally and regionally. The disease burden due to most foodborne parasites is highly focal and results in significant morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {The rat lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a food-borne zoonotic parasite, has been recognized as the primary pathogen associated with human eosinophilic meningitis or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis. This neurotropic nematode has a definitive rodent host and a molluscan intermediate host. The adult worms live in the pulmonary arteries of rats. Human is a non-permissive, accidental host. Transmission to humans is by eating of infected raw or undercooked snails, poorly cleaned contaminated vegetables or other infected paratenic hosts such as freshwater prawns, crabs, frogs or monitor lizards. Thousands of diagnosed cases of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis have been reported worldwide. Angiostrongyliasis is of increasing public health importance as globalization contributes to the geographical spread and more international travelers encounter the disease. The parasite is on the move. It has spread from its traditional endemic areas of Asia and the Pacific Basin to the American continent including the USA, Brazil and Caribbean islands. Recently, the incidence of human infections has increased rapidly. Most reports of the disease are from Thailand and Taiwan with increasing reports from mainland China. The rapid global spread of the parasite and the emerging occurrence of the infection pose challenges in clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and in epidemiology and basic biology. Enhanced understanding of the epidemiology of angiostrongyliasis, increased public awareness about the risks associated with eating raw or undercooked food, and enhanced food safety measures are needed. Therefore, current knowledge on various aspects of the parasite and the disease it causes, as well as recent epidemiological status together with significant progress in laboratory investigation of A. cantonensis infection, are overviewed to promote understanding and awareness of this emerging neglected disease.},

	abstract = {There is a wide variety of food products that may be contaminated with one or more parasites and consequently enabling transmission to human beings. The prevalence of specific parasites in food supplies varies between countries and regions. Sources of food-borne products contaminated with parasites are pigs, cattle, fish, crabs, crayfish, snails, frogs, snakes and aquatic plants. One of the major factors influencing the prevalence of parasitic infections in the population is the habit, and traditional popularity of eating raw or inadequately cooked foods. The parasites that may be acquired by eating these foods are nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and protozoa. The major genera of parasites are Trichinella, Gnathostoma, Angiostrongylus, Anisakis, Paragonimus, Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola, Fasciolopsis, Echinostoma, Taenia, Spirometra and Toxoplasma. These food-borne parasitic infections are public health problems worldwide. The contamination of food affects many including humans, livestock industry, agriculture, and food manufacturing and processing. Unsafe foods must be condemned and destroyed. Today there is increasing travel hence there is the risk of humans' acquiring food-borne parasitic infections through eating native food often raw. Moreover, the consumption of imported livestock and foods, especially from endemic areas of food-borne parasitic zoonoses, can be the cause of infection. Awareness should be heightened wherever and whenever raw or inadequately cooked food are consumed.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of Homo sapiens has a pivotal role to play in the macro and microepidemiology of emerging or re-emerging parasitic zoonoses. Changing demographics and the concomitant alterations to the environment, climate, technology, land use and changes in human behavior, converge to favour the emergence and spread of parasitic zoonoses. The recent unprecedented movements of people, their animals and their parasites around the world, introduce and mix genes, cultural preferences, customs, and behavioral patterns. The increasing proclivity for eating meat, fish, crabs, shrimp, molluscs raw, undercooked, smoked, pickled or dried facilitates a number of protozoan (Toxoplasma), trematode (Fasciola sp., Paragonimus spp., Clonorchis sp., Opisthorchis spp., Heterophyes sp., Metagonimus sp., Echinostoma spp., Nanophyetus sp.) cestode (Taenia spp, Diphyllobothrum sp.) and nematode (Trichinella spp., Capillaria spp., Gnathostoma spp., Anisakis sp., Parastrongylus spp.) caused zoonoses. The increasing world population and the inability to keep pace with the provision of adequate sanitation and clean, safe drinking water, has led to an increased importance of waterborne zoonoses, such as those caused by Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma. Our close relationship with and the numerous uses to which we put companion animals and their ubiquitous distribution has resulted in dogs and cats unwitting participation in sharing over 60 parasite species including: Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, most foodborne trematode species, Diphyllobothrum, Echinococcus spp., Ancylostoma and Toxocara. Changing human behaviour through education, to encourage the proper cooking of food, which may have cultural and social significance, will remain as challenging as controlling stray and feral pet populations, improving hygiene levels and the provision of safe drinking water and the proper use of sanctuary facilities. Long pre-patent periods and the normally insidious sub-clinical nature of most zoonoses makes advice requiring behavioural change for their control a difficult task. Our clearer understanding of the heterogeneity of susceptibility to infection, the complex genetic variations of people and parasite species and the development of molecular epidemiological tools is shedding more light on transmission routes and the spectrum of disease that is observed. Improved and new serological, molecular and imaging diagnostic tests and the development of broad spectrum chemotherapeutic agents has led to the attenuation of morbidity and mortality due to parasitic zoonoses in economically advantaged regions. Such advancements, in partnership with supportive behavioural change, has the potential for a sustainable global reduction in the burden of ill health due to parasitic zoonoses. Whether this will materialise is a challenge for us all.},

Although S. marcescens displays relatively low virulence, it causes nosocomial infections and outbreaks in severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients, particularly in settings such as intensive care units (ICUs), especially neonatal units (NICUs). This microorganism gives rise to a wide range of clinical manifestations in newborns: from asymptomatic colonization to keratitis, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, surgical wound infections, sepsis, bloodstream infection and meningitis. The most frequent site of infection is the bloodstream, followed by the respiratory apparatus and the gastrointestinal tract. Strains of S. marcescens involved in epidemic events have frequently proved to be multi-resistant. Indeed, this species displays intrinsic resistance to several classes of antibiotics. Often, the specific source of the infection cannot be identified. However, the contaminated hands of healthcare workers are believed to be a major vehicle of its transmission. In neonatal intensive care units, colonized or infected newborns are the main potential source of S. marcescens, particularly in the respiratory apparatus, but also in the gastrointestinal tract. The early identification of colonized or infected patients and the prompt implementation of infection control measures, particularly rigorous hand hygiene and contact precautions, are essential in order to curb the spread of infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection with Serratia spp. have been associated with mastitis outbreaks in dairy cattle herds. Environmental contamination or a point source, like a teat dip product, have often been observed to be potential sources of such outbreaks. We describe two Serratia marcescens associated mastitis outbreaks associated with a contaminated teat dip containing a tertiary alkyl amine, n,n-bis (3-aminopropyl) dodecylamine in two dairy cattle farms in Finland. S. marcescens strains isolated from milk and environmental samples were identified by the MALDI-TOF method.
RESULTS: Six specimens (n = 19) on Herd 1 and all specimens (n = 9) on Herd 2 were positive for S. marcescens. Positive specimens were from mastitis milk and teat dip liquid and equipment. Bacteria were not isolated from the unopened teat dip canister. The same clone of S. marcescens was isolated from milk samples and teat dip samples within the farms. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis results to the S. marcescens isolates from these two different herds were tested with unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic average clustering analysis. The isolates were not same clone in both herds, because similarity in that test was only 75\% when cut-off value to similarity is 85\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation showed that the post milking teat dip and/or temporary containers were contaminated with S. marcescens and these were most likely the sources for new mastitis cases. The negative result from the unopened teat dip canister and positive results from refillable containers demonstrated that the product itself was not contaminated with S. marcescens at the production unit, but became contaminated at the farm level.},

	abstract = {After many years in the family Vibrionaceae, the genus Plesiomonas, represented by a single species, P. shigelloides, currently resides in the family Enterobacteriaceae, although its most appropriate phylogenetic position may yet to be determined. Common environmental reservoirs for plesiomonads include freshwater ecosystems and estuaries and inhabitants of these aquatic environs. Long suspected as being an etiologic agent of bacterial gastroenteritis, convincing evidence supporting this conclusion has accumulated over the past 2 decades in the form of a series of foodborne outbreaks solely or partially attributable to P. shigelloides. The prevalence of P. shigelloides enteritis varies considerably, with higher rates reported from Southeast Asia and Africa and lower numbers from North America and Europe. Reasons for these differences may include hygiene conditions, dietary habits, regional occupations, or other unknown factors. Other human illnesses caused by P. shigelloides include septicemia and central nervous system disease, eye infections, and a variety of miscellaneous ailments. For years, recognizable virulence factors potentially associated with P. shigelloides pathogenicity were lacking; however, several good candidates now have been reported, including a cytotoxic hemolysin, iron acquisition systems, and lipopolysaccharide. While P. shigelloides is easy to identify biochemically, it is often overlooked in stool samples due to its smaller colony size or relatively low prevalence in gastrointestinal samples. However, one FDA-approved PCR-based culture-independent diagnostic test system to detect multiple enteropathogens (FilmArray) includes P. shigelloides on its panel. Plesiomonads produce β-lactamases but are typically susceptible to many first-line antimicrobial agents, including quinolones and carbapenems.},

It is a direct zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to different pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. Large number of animals acts as carriers or vectors.Human infection results from accidental contact with carrier animals or environment contaminated with leptospires. The primary source of leptospires is the excretor animal, from whose renal tubules leptospires are excreted into the environment with the animal urine. Majority of leptospiral infections are either sub clinical or result in very mild illness and recover without any complications.However,a small proportion develops various complications due to involvement of multiple organ systems. In such patients, the clinical presentation depends upon the predominant organs involved and the case fatality ratio could be about 40\% or more. Febrile illness with icterus, splenomegaly and nephritis (known as Weil's disease), acute febrile illness with severe muscle pain,febrile illness with pulmonary haemorrhages in the form of haemoptysis, jaundice with pulmonary haemorrhages, jaundice with heamaturea, meningitis with haemorrhages including sub conjunctival haemorrhage or febrile illness with cardiac arrhythmias with or without haemorrhages are some of the syndromes. Because of the protean manifestations of leptospirosis it is often misdiagnosed and under-reported. Although the basic principles of prevention such as source reduction,environmental sanitation, more hygienic work-related and personal practices etc., are same everywhere, there is no universal control method applicable to all epidemiological settings. Comprehensive understanding of the eco-epidemiological and cultural characteristics of a community that faces the problem of leptospirosis is an essential prerequisite for evolving an effective and acceptable control measure.},

In addition to established examples such as salmonella, campylobacter and listeria, recent evidence is emerging of the role of food in the transmission of Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Food-borne pathogens harboured by ruminants are spread through shedding in the faeces and subsequent faecal contamination of raw food. Ruminant shedding appears to be affected by diet and, of particular concern, may be increased during fasting regimens imposed during transport to the slaughterhouse. The survival of food-borne pathogens in the ruminant gut is affected by many factors including microbe-microbe interactions, interactions involving plant metabolites and the presence of inhibitory end-product metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. The potential importance of digesta flow and bacterial detachment in shedding of food-borne pathogens is discussed. Experimental procedures with dangerous pathogens have constraints, particularly in animal experimentation. This situation may be overcome by the use of rumen-simulating fermentors. One such system which, like the natural rumen, has a different turnover rate for solid and liquid digesta, was found to maintain rumen-like variables over an 11 d period. This system may prove useful for the study of dietary effects on food-borne pathogens.},

At that time described as a 'rare, unnamed halophilic lactose-fermenting Vibrio species', V. vulnificus has emerged as the most virulent foodborne pathogen in the United States with a hospitalization rate of 0.910 and a case-fatality rate of 0.390. It is in addition a significant cause of potentially life-threatening wound infections. Infections following ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood, commonly raw oysters, can lead to a primary septicaemia with a fatality rate of 50-60\%. An unusual symptom, occurring in 69\% of 274 cases reviewed by Oliver, is the development of secondary lesions, typically on the extremities, which are generally severe (often a necrotizing fasciitis) and require tissue debridement or amputation. These cases occur almost exclusively in males over the age of 50 years. Interestingly, this gender specificity has been found to be due to the female hormone oestrogen, which in some manner provides protection against the lethal V. vulnificus endotoxin. Further, most cases occur in persons with certain underlying diseases which are either immunocompromising or which lead to elevated serum iron levels (e.g. liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, haemochromatosis). V. vulnificus infections resulting in primary septicaemia have been extensively studied, and the subject of several reviews. This review concentrates on the wound infections caused by this marine bacterial pathogen, including the more recently described biotypes 2 and 3, with brief discussions of those caused by other marine vibrios, and the increasingly reported wound/skin infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Aeromnonas hydrophila.},

Before the introduction of universal vaccination in the 1940s - 1950, it was the primary cause of disease and death in children and young adults. However, after the introduction of universal immunization, the incidence of the disease has been reduced drastically to almost 5000 annually worldwide.[2] Due to different factors including low socioeconomic status, inadequate income, inaccessibility to public health, war and displacement, and ineffective monitoring of the immunization schedule has led to frequent sporadic outbreaks of the disease around the world. In this topic, we aim to provide a refresher course on Corynebacterium diphtheria.},

	abstract = {Disease outbreaks caused by the ingestion of contaminated vegetables and fruits pose a significant problem to human health. The sources of contamination of these food products at the preharvest level of agricultural production, most importantly, agricultural soil and irrigation water, serve as potential reservoirs of some clinically significant foodborne pathogenic bacteria. These clinically important bacteria include: Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., Citrobacter spp., Shigella spp., Enterobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes and pathogenic E. coli (and E. coli O157:H7) all of which have the potential to cause disease outbreaks. Most of these pathogens acquire antimicrobial resistance (AR) determinants due to AR selective pressure within the agroecosystem and become resistant against most available treatment options, further aggravating risks to human and environmental health, and food safety. This review critically outlines the following issues with regards to fresh produce; the global burden of fresh produce-related foodborne diseases, contamination between the continuum of farm to table, preharvest transmission routes, AR profiles, and possible interventions to minimize the preharvest contamination of fresh produce. This review reveals that the primary production niches of the agro-ecosystem play a significant role in the transmission of fresh produce associated pathogens as well as their resistant variants, thus detrimental to food safety and public health.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Bongkrekic acid (BA) has a unique mechanism of toxicity among the mitochondrial toxins: it inhibits adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) rather than the electron transport chain. Bongkrekic acid is produced by the bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pathovar cocovenenans (B. cocovenenans) which has been implicated in outbreaks of food-borne illness involving coconut- and corn-based products in Indonesia and China. Our objective was to summarize what is known about the epidemiology, exposure sources, toxicokinetics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis and treatment of human BA poisoning.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), EMBASE (1947 to present), SCOPUS, The Indonesia Publication Index ( http://id.portalgaruda.org/ ), ToxNet, book chapters, Google searches, Pro-MED alerts, and references from previously published journal articles. We identified a total of 109 references which were reviewed. Of those, 29 (26 \%) had relevant information and were included. Bongkrekic acid is a heat-stable, highly unsaturated tricarboxylic fatty acid with a molecular weight of 486 kDa. Outbreaks have been reported from Indonesia, China, and more recently in Mozambique. Very little is known about the toxicokinetics of BA. Bongkrekic acid produces its toxic effects by inhibiting mitochondrial (ANT). ANT can also alter cellular apoptosis. Signs and symptoms in humans are similar to the clinical findings from other mitochondrial poisons, but they vary in severity and time course. Management of patients is symptomatic and supportive.
CONCLUSIONS: Bongkrekic acid is a mitochondrial ANT toxin and is reported primarily in outbreaks of food-borne poisoning involving coconut and corn. It should be considered in outbreaks of food-borne illness when signs and symptoms manifest involving the liver, brain, and kidneys and when coconut- or corn-based foods are implicated.},

Cell extracts of the toxigenic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited sperm motility, damaged cell membrane integrity, depleted cellular ATP, and swelled the acrosome, but no mitochondrial damage was observed. The responsible agent from the B. licheniformis isolates was partially purified. It showed physicochemical properties similar to those of cereulide, despite having very different biological activity. The toxic agent was nonproteinaceous; soluble in 50 and 100\% methanol; and insensitive to heat, protease, and acid or alkali and of a molecular mass smaller than 10,000 g mol−1. The toxic B. licheniformis isolates inhibited growth of Corynebacterium renale DSM 20688T, but not all inhibitory isolates were sperm toxic. The food poisoning-related isolates were beta-hemolytic, grew anaerobically and at 55°C but not at 10°C, and were nondistinguishable from the type strain of B. licheniformis, DSM 13T, by a broad spectrum of biochemical tests. Ribotyping revealed more diversity; the toxin producers were divided among four ribotypes when cut with PvuII and among six when cut with EcoRI, but many of the ribotypes also contained nontoxigenic isolates. When ribotyped with PvuII, most toxin-producing isolates shared bands at 2.8 ± 0.2, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 11.7 ± 0.5 or 13.1 ± 0.8 kb.},

	doi = {10.3390/microorganisms7030091},
	abstract = {Minimally processed and ready-to-eat (RTE) seafood products are gaining popularity because of their availability in retail stores and the consumers' perception of convenience. Products that are subjected to mild processing and products that do not require additional heating prior to consumption are eaten by an increasing proportion of the population, including people that are more susceptible to foodborne disease. Worldwide, seafood is an important source of foodborne outbreaks, but the exact burden is not known. The increased interest in seafood products for raw consumption introduces new food safety issues that must be addressed by all actors in the food chain. Bacteria belonging to genus Aeromonas are ubiquitous in marine environments, and Aeromonas spp. has held the title "emerging foodborne pathogen" for more than a decade. Given its high prevalence in seafood and in vegetables included in many RTE seafood meals, the significance of Aeromonas as a potential foodborne pathogen and a food spoilage organism increases. Some Aeromonas spp. can grow relatively uninhibited in food during refrigeration under a broad range of pH and NaCl concentrations, and in various packaging atmospheres. Strains of several Aeromonas species have shown spoilage potential by the production of spoilage associated metabolites in various seafood products, but the knowledge on spoilage in cold water fish species is scarce. The question about the significance of Aeromonas spp. in RTE seafood products is challenged by the limited knowledge on how to identify the truly virulent strains. The limited information on clinically relevant strains is partly due to few registered outbreaks, and to the disputed role as a true foodborne pathogen. However, it is likely that illness caused by Aeromonas might go on undetected due to unreported cases and a lack of adequate identification schemes. A rather confusing taxonomy and inadequate biochemical tests for species identification has led to a biased focus towards some Aeromonas species. Over the last ten years, several housekeeping genes has replaced the 16S rRNA gene as suitable genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis. The result is a more clear and robust taxonomy and updated knowledge on the currently circulating environmental strains. Nevertheless, more knowledge on which factors that contribute to virulence and how to control the potential pathogenic strains of Aeromonas in perishable RTE seafood products are needed.},

To better understand the potential public health risks posed by Arcobacter, this review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the global distribution and the prevalence of Arcobacter in food and water. Arcobacter spp. were identified in food animals, food-processing environments and a variety of foods, including vegetables, poultry, beef, dairy products, seafood, pork, lamb and rabbit. A wide range of waterbodies has been reported to be contaminated with Arcobacter spp., such as wastewater, seawater, lake and river water, drinking water, groundwater and recreational water. In addition, Arcobacter has also been isolated from pets, domestic birds, wildlife, zoo and farm animals. It is expected that advancements in molecular techniques will facilitate better detection worldwide and aid in understanding the pathogenicity of Arcobacter. However, more extensive and rigorous surveillance systems are needed to better understand the occurrence of Arcobacter in food and water in various regions of the world, as well as uncover other potential public health risks, that is antibiotic resistance and disinfection efficiency, to reduce the possibility of foodborne and waterborne infections.},

Newer species of Arcobacter are being incessantly emerging (presently 25 species have been identified) with novel information on the evolutionary mechanisms and genetic diversity among different Arcobacter species. These have been reported from chickens, domestic animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, horses, dogs), reptiles (lizards, snakes and chelonians), meat (poultry, pork, goat, lamb, beef, rabbit), vegetables and from humans in different countries. Arcobacters are implicated as causative agents of diarrhea, mastitis and abortion in animals, while causing bacteremia, endocarditis, peritonitis, gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans. Three species including A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii are predominantly associated with clinical conditions. Arcobacters are primarily transmitted through contaminated food and water sources. Identification of Arcobacter by biochemical tests is difficult and isolation remains the gold standard method. Current diagnostic advances have provided various molecular methods for efficient detection and differentiation of the Arcobacters at genus and species level. To overcome the emerging antibiotic resistance problem there is an essential need to explore the potential of novel and alternative therapies. Strengthening of the diagnostic aspects is also suggested as in most cases Arcobacters goes unnoticed and hence the exact epidemiological status remains uncertain.

Nevertheless, several species of Acinetobacter, especially A. baumannii, possess many of the characteristics associated with successful pathogens and exhibit a prodigious ability to acquire the multiple-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype.

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus causes various diseases ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening infections. Adaptation to the different host niches is controlled by a complex network of transcriptional regulators. Global profiling of condition-dependent transcription revealed adaptation of S. aureus HG001 at the levels of transcription initiation and termination. In particular, deletion of the gene encoding the Rho transcription termination factor triggered a remarkable overall increase in antisense transcription and gene expression changes attributable to indirect regulatory effects. The goal of the present study was a detailed comparative analysis of S. aureus HG001 and its isogenic rho deletion mutant. Proteome analysis revealed significant differences in cellular and extracellular protein profiles, most notably increased amounts of the proteins belonging to the SaeR regulon in the Rho-deficient strain. The SaeRS two-component system acts as a major regulator of virulence gene expression in staphylococci. Higher levels of SaeRS-dependent virulence factors such as adhesins, toxins, and immune evasion proteins in the rho mutant resulted in higher virulence in a murine bacteremia model, which was alleviated in a rho complemented strain. Inhibition of Rho activity by bicyclomycin, a specific inhibitor of Rho activity, also induced the expression of SaeRS-dependent genes, at both the mRNA and protein levels, to the same extent as observed in the rho mutant. Taken together, these findings indicate that activation of the Sae system in the absence of Rho is directly linked to Rho’s transcription termination activity and establish a new link between antibiotic action and virulence gene expression in S. aureus.
IMPORTANCE The major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a widespread commensal bacterium but also the most common cause of nosocomial infections. It adapts to the different host niches through a complex gene regulatory network. We show here that the Rho transcription termination factor, which represses pervasive antisense transcription in various bacteria, including S. aureus, plays a role in controlling SaeRS-dependent virulence gene expression. A Rho-deficient strain produces larger amounts of secreted virulence factors in vitro and shows increased virulence in mice. We also show that treatment of S. aureus with the antibiotic bicyclomycin, which inhibits Rho activity and is effective against Gram-negative bacteria, induces the same changes in the proteome as observed in the Rho-deficient strain. Our results reveal for the first time a link between transcription termination and virulence regulation in S. aureus, which implies a novel mechanism by which an antibiotic can modulate the expression of virulence factors.},

	abstract = {Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry promises higher performance in terms of quantification and reproducibility compared to data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry methods. To enable high-accuracy quantification of Staphylococcus aureus proteins, we have developed a global ion library for data-independent acquisition approaches employing high-resolution time of flight or Orbitrap instruments for this human pathogen. We applied this ion library resource to investigate the time-resolved adaptation of S. aureus to the intracellular niche in human bronchial epithelial cells and in a murine pneumonia model. In epithelial cells, abundance changes for more than 400 S. aureus proteins were quantified, revealing, e.g., the precise temporal regulation of the SigB-dependent stress response and differential regulation of translation, fermentation, and amino acid biosynthesis. Using an in vivo murine pneumonia model, our data-independent acquisition quantification analysis revealed for the first time the in vivo proteome adaptation of S. aureus. From approximately 2.15 × 105 S. aureus cells, 578 proteins were identified. Increased abundance of proteins required for oxidative stress response, amino acid biosynthesis, and fermentation together with decreased abundance of ribosomal proteins and nucleotide reductase NrdEF was observed in post-infection samples compared to the pre-infection state.},

	abstract = {Chemotactic behaviour is an important part of the lifestyle of motile bacteria and enables cells to respond to various environmental stimuli. The Hard Agar Plug (HAP) method is used to study the chemotactic behaviour of bacteria, including the fastidious microaerophile Campylobacter jejuni, an intestinal pathogen of humans. However, the traditional HAP assay is not quantitative, is unsuitable for chemotaxis observation over short time periods and for the investigation of repellent taxis, and is prone to false-positive and -negative results. Here we report an accurate, rapid, and quantitative HAP-based chemotaxis assay, tHAP, for the investigation of bacterial chemotactic responses. The critical component of the new assay is the addition of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Enzymatic reduction of TTC to TFP-Red (1, 3, 5-Triphenylformazan) enables colourimetric detection of actively metabolising bacterial cells. Quantitative assessment of chemotaxis is achieved by colourimetric measurement or viability count over a period of 10 min to 3 h. Using the tHAP assay, we observed the dose-responsive chemotactic motility of C. jejuni cells along different concentrations of attractants aspartate and serine. Importantly, we have also designed a competitive tHAP assay to differentiate between repellents and attractants and to identify chemoeffectors that do not activate metabolism.
IMPORTANCE: The modified tHAP assay described here enables the exploration of the chemoresponse of Campylobacter jejuni towards chemorepellents, and catabolizable and non-catabolizable chemoattractants.},

	abstract = {Aims This study was conducted to investigate the inactivation kinetics of Bacillus cereus vegetative cells upon exposure to low-temperature nitrogen gas plasma and to reveal the mode of inactivation by transcriptome profiling. Methods and Results Exponentially growing B. cereus cells were filtered and put on agar plates. The plates, carrying the filters with the vegetative cells, were placed into low-temperature nitrogen gas plasma at atmospheric pressure. After different exposure times, the cells were harvested for RNA extraction and enumeration. The RNA was used to perform whole-transcriptome profiling using DNA microarrays. The transcriptome profile showed a large overlap with profiles obtained from conditions generating reactive oxygen species in B. cereus. However, excess radicals such as peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and superoxide could not be detected using radical-specific fluorescence staining. Lack of UV-specific responses including factors involved in DNA damage repair is in line with the absence of UV-specific emission in the afterglow of the nitrogen gas plasma as analysed using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Conclusions Antibacterial activity of nitrogen gas plasma is not based on UV radiation. Exposure to nitrogen gas plasma leads to oxidative stress and inactivation of targeted cells. A secondary oxidative stress with the indicative formation of reactive oxygen species within cells could not be observed. Significance and Impact of the Study This study represents the first investigation of differential gene expression on a genome-wide scale in B. cereus following nitrogen gas plasma exposure. This study may help to design economically feasible, safe and effective plasma decontamination devices.},

	abstract = {The alternative transcription factor σB of Bacillus cereus controls the expression of a number of genes that respond to environmental stress. Four proteins encoded in the sigB gene cluster, including RsbV, RsbW, RsbY (RsbU) and RsbK, are known to be essential in the σB-mediated stress response. In the context of stress, the hybrid sensor kinase RsbK is thought to phosphorylate the response regulator RsbY, a PP2C serine phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated RsbV. The unphosphorylated RsbV then sequesters the σB antagonist, RsbW, ultimately liberating σB. The gene arrangement reveals an open reading frame, bc1007, flanked immediately downstream by rsbK within the sigB gene cluster. However, little is known about the function of bc1007. In this study, the deletion of bc1007 resulted in high constitutive σB expression independent of environmental stimuli, indicating that bc1007 plays a role in σB regulation. A bacterial two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that BC1007 interacts directly with RsbK, and autoradiographic studies revealed a specific C14-methyl transfer from the radiolabelled S-adenosylmethionine to RsbK when RsbK was incubated with purified BC1007. Our data suggest that BC1007 (RsbM) negatively regulates σB activity by methylating RsbK. Additionally, mutagenic substitution was employed to modify 12 predicted methylation residues in RsbK. Certain RsbK mutants were able to rescue σB activation in a rsbK-deleted bacterial strain, but RsbKE439A failed to activate σB, and RsbKE446A only moderately induced σB. These results suggest that Glu439 is the preferred methylation site and that Glu446 is potentially a minor methylation site. Gene arrays of the rsbK orthologues and the neighbouring rsbM orthologues are found in a wide range of bacteria. The regulation of sigma factors through metylation of RsbK-like sensor kinases appears to be widespread in the microbial world.},

	abstract = {A gene cluster encoding the alternative sigma factor sigma(B), three predicted regulators of sigma(B) (RsbV, RsbW, and RsbY), and one protein whose function is not known (Orf4) was identified in the genome sequence of the food pathogen Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579. Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against sigma(B) revealed that there was 20.1-fold activation of sigma(B) after a heat shock from 30 to 42 degrees C. Osmotic upshock and ethanol exposure also upregulated sigma(B), albeit less than a heat shock. When the intracellular ATP concentration was decreased by exposure to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), only limited increases in sigma(B) levels were observed, revealing that stress due to ATP depletion is not an important factor in sigma(B) activation in B. cereus. Analysis of transcription of the sigB operon by Northern blotting and primer extension revealed the presence of a sigma(B)-dependent promoter upstream of the first open reading frame (rsbV) of the sigB operon, indicating that transcription of sigB is autoregulated. A second sigma(B)-dependent promoter was identified upstream of the last open reading frame (orf4) of the sigB operon. Production of virulence factors and the nonhemolytic enterotoxin Nhe in a sigB null mutant was the same as in the parent strain. However, sigma(B) was found to play a role in the protective heat shock response of B. cereus. The sigB null mutant was less protected against the lethal temperature of 50 degrees C by a preadaptation to 42 degrees C than the parent strain was, resulting in a more-than-100-fold-reduced survival of the mutant after 40 min at 50 degrees C.},

	abstract = {Real-time reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) is the most suitable method for the detection and quantification of mRNA. It offers high sensitivity, good reproducibility and a wide quantification range. Today, relative expression is increasingly used, where the expression of a target gene is standardised by a non-regulated reference gene. Several mathematical algorithms have been developed to compute an expression ratio, based on real-time PCR efficiency and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. But all published equations and available models for the calculation of relative expression ratio allow only for the determination of a single transcription difference between one control and one sample. Therefore a new software tool was established, named REST© (relative expression software tool), which compares two groups, with up to 16 data points in a sample and 16 in a control group, for reference and up to four target genes. The mathematical model used is based on the PCR efficiencies and the mean crossing point deviation between the sample and control group. Subsequently, the expression ratio results of the four investigated transcripts are tested for significance by a randomisation test. Herein, development and application of REST© is explained and the usefulness of relative expression in real-time PCR using REST© is discussed. The latest software version of REST© and examples for the correct use can be downloaded at http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/.},

But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve.

In the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus, the alternative sigma factor sigma(B) is activated by the RR RsbY. Here we present strong indications that the PP2C-type phosphatase RsbY receives its input from the multi-sensor hybrid kinase BC1008 (renamed RsbK). Genome analyses revealed that, across bacilli, rsbY and rsbK are located in a conserved gene cluster. A B. cereus rsbK deletion strain was shown to be incapable of inducing sigma(B) upon stress conditions and was impaired in its heat adaptive response. Comparison of the wild-type and rsbK mutant transcriptomes upon heat shock revealed that RsbK was primarily involved in the activation of the sigma(B)-mediated stress response. Truncation of the RsbK RR receiver domain demonstrated the importance of this domain for sigma(B) induction upon stress. The domain architecture of RsbK suggests that in the B. cereus group and in other bacilli, environmental and intracellular stress signalling routes are combined into one single protein. This strategy is markedly different from the sigma(B) activation pathway in other low-GC Gram-positives.},

	abstract = {In biotechnological workhorses like Streptococcus thermophilus and Bacillus subtilis, natural competence can be induced, which facilitates genetic manipulation of these microbes. However, in strains of the important dairy starter Lactococcus lactis, natural competence has not been established to date. However, in silico analysis of the complete genome sequences of 43 L. lactis strains revealed complete late competence gene sets in 2 L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains (KW2 and KW10) and at least 10 L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, including the model strain IL1403 and the plant-derived strain KF147. The remainder of the strains, including all dairy isolates, displayed genomic decay in one or more of the late competence genes. Nisin-controlled expression of the competence regulator comX in L. lactis subsp. lactis KF147 resulted in the induction of expression of the canonical competence regulon and elicited a state of natural competence in this strain. In contrast, comX expression in L. lactis NZ9000, which was predicted to encode an incomplete competence gene set, failed to induce natural competence. Moreover, mutagenesis of the comEA-EC operon in strain KF147 abolished the comX-driven natural competence, underlining the involvement of the competence machinery. Finally, introduction of nisin-inducible comX expression into nisRK-harboring derivatives of strains IL1403 and KW2 allowed the induction of natural competence in these strains also, expanding this phenotype to other L. lactis strains of both subspecies.
IMPORTANCE Specific bacterial species are able to enter a state of natural competence in which DNA is taken up from the environment, allowing the introduction of novel traits. Strains of the species Lactococcus lactis are very important starter cultures for the fermentation of milk in the cheese production process, where these bacteria contribute to the flavor and texture of the end product. The activation of natural competence in this industrially relevant organism can accelerate research aiming to understand industrially relevant traits of these bacteria and can facilitate engineering strategies to harness the natural biodiversity of the species in optimized starter strains.},

Several polyketide-derived macrolides as well as nonribosomal peptides, dihydroisocoumarins, and linear lipopeptides with antimicrobial properties have been reported, demonstrating the biosynthetic arsenal of this bacterium. Promising efforts toward the application of B. subtilis strains and their natural products in areas of agriculture and medicine are underway. However, industrial-scale availability of these compounds is currently limited by low fermentation yields and challenging accessibility via synthesis, necessitating the development of genetically engineered strains and optimized cultivation processes.

At first, the biosynthesis of this remarkable biosurfactant was described in this review. The peptide moiety of the surfactin is synthesized using huge multienzymatic proteins called NonRibosomal Peptide Synthetases. This mechanism is responsible for the peptide biodiversity of the members of the surfactin family. In addition, on the fatty acid side, fifteen different isoforms (from C12 to C17) can be incorporated so increasing the number of the surfactin-like biomolecules. The review also highlights the last development in metabolic modelling and engineering and in synthetic biology to direct surfactin biosynthesis but also to generate novel derivatives. This large set of different biomolecules leads to a broad spectrum of physico-chemical properties and biological activities. The last parts of the review summarized the numerous studies related to the production processes optimization as well as the approaches developed to increase the surfactin productivity of Bacillus cells taking into account the different steps of its biosynthesis from gene transcription to surfactin degradation in the culture medium.},

In the presence of surfactin, AFM topographic images showed phase separation for each surfactin–phospholipid system except for surfactin–DMPC, which was in good agreement with compression isotherms. On the basis of domain shape and line tension theory, we conclude that the miscibility between surfactin and phospholipids is higher for shorter chain lengths (DMPC{\textgreater}DPPC{\textgreater}DSPC) and that the polar headgroup of phospholipids influences the miscibility of surfactin in the order DPPC{\textgreater}DPPE{\textgreater}DPPS. Molecular modeling data show that mixing surfactin and DPPC has a destabilizing effect on DPPC monolayer while it has a stabilizing effect towards DPPE and DPPS molecular interactions. Our results provide valuable information on the activity mechanism of surfactin and may be useful for the design of surfactin delivery systems.},

The first part of this chapter reviews the classic mechanisms that control SM and describes some applications in process and strain improvement. The second section describes the new and expanded view of regulation in their different levels. After this, the findings on SM regulation in solid-state fermentation (SSF), and its relation to SSF-specific environmental cues inducing SMs, are examined.

	abstract = {Spo0A∼P is the master regulator of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Activity of Spo0A is regulated by a phosphorelay integrating multiple positive and negative signals by the action of kinases and phosphatases. The phosphatase Spo0E specifically inactivates the response regulator Spo0A∼P by dephosphorylation. We identified a σB-type promoter adjacent to spo0E that is activated by the general stress response sigma factor σB and is responsible for spo0E induction in vivo. Ectopic expression of σB and subsequent induction of spo0E cause a σB-dependent block of sporulation-specific transcription of the spo0A and spoIIE genes and produces a sporulation-deficient phenotype. This effect could be erased by a deletion of the σB promoter of spo0E and thus solely addresses σB activity. Here, a molecular mechanism is shown that integrates σB activity into the decision-making process of sporulation and provides a link to interconnect these two dominant and probably mutually exclusive adaptive responses in the regulatory network of B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {The general stress response and the decision-making processes of sporulation initiation are interconnected pathways in the regulatory network of Bacillus subtilis. In a previous study we provided evidence for a mechanism capable of impairing sporulation by σB-dependent induction of spo0E, encoding a phosphatase specifically inactivating the sporulation master regulator Spo0A∼P. Here we show that the σB promoter (PσB) of spo0E is responsive to sub-inhibitory levels of ethanol stress, producing a σB-dependent sporulation deficient phenotype. In addition to positive regulation by σB, we identified Rok, the repressor of comK, to be a direct repressor of spo0E expression from PσB. This constellation provides the possibility to integrate signals negatively acting on sporulation initiation through the σB branch as well as a positive feedback loop acting on PσB by Rok that is most likely a direct consequence of Spo0A∼P activity. Thus, the molecular mechanism described here offers the opportunity for cross-talk between the general stress response and sporulation initiation in the adaptational gene expression network of B. subtilis.},

However, very little is known about how these PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and exhibit the antifungal response. Here, we report the antagonistic interaction between Bacillus subtilis and the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides We demonstrate that this bacterial-fungal interaction triggers the induction of the SigB transcription factor, the master regulator of B. subtilis stress adaptation. Dual-growth experiments performed with live or dead mycelia or culture supernatants of F. verticillioides showed that SigB was activated and required for the biocontrol of fungal growth. Mutations in the different regulatory pathways of SigB activation in the isogenic background revealed that only the energy-related RsbP-dependent arm of SigB activation was responsible for specific fungal detection and triggering the antagonistic response. The activation of SigB increased the expression of the operon responsible for the production of the antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (the srfA operon). SigB-deficient B. subtilis cultures produced decreased amounts of surfactin, and B. subtilis cultures defective in surfactin production (ΔsrfA) were unable to control the growth of F. verticillioidesIn vivo experiments of seed germination efficiency and early plant growth inhibition in the presence of F. verticillioides confirmed the physiological importance of SigB activity for plant bioprotection.IMPORTANCE Biological control using beneficial bacteria (PGPRs) represents an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to pesticides for controlling plant diseases. Different PGPR Bacillus species produce potent biofungicides and stimulate plant defense responses against phytopathogenic fungi. However, very little is known about how PGPRs recognize phytopathogens and process the antifungal response.

Here, we show how stochastic pulsing of gene expression enables spatial patterns to form in a model multicellular system, Bacillus subtilis bacterial biofilms. We use quantitative microscopy and time-lapse imaging to observe pulses in the activity of the general stress response sigma factor σB in individual cells during biofilm development. Both σB and sporulation activity increase in a gradient, peaking at the top of the biofilm, even though σB represses sporulation. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, increasing σB expression shifts the peak of sporulation to the middle of the biofilm. Our results demonstrate how stochastic pulsing of gene expression can play a key role in pattern formation during biofilm development.},

	abstract = {Alternative transcription factor sigma B of Bacillus subtilis controls a stationary-phase regulon induced under growth conditions that do not favor sporulation. Little is known about the metabolic signals and protein factors regulating the activity of sigma B. The operon containing the sigma B structural gene has the gene order orfV-orfW-sigB-rsbX, and operon expression is autoregulated positively by sigma B and negatively by the rsbX product (rsbX = regulator of sigma B). To establish the roles of the orfV and orfW products, orfV and orfW null and missense mutations were constructed and tested for their effects on expression of the sigma B-dependent genes ctc and csbA. These mutations were tested in two contexts: in the first, the sigB operon was under control of its wild-type, sigma B-dependent promoter, and in the second, the sigB operon promoter was replaced by the inducible Pspac promoter. The principal findings are that (i) the orfV (now called rsbV) product is a positive regulator of sigma B-dependent gene expression; (ii) the orfW (now called rsbW) product is a negative regultor of such expression; (iii) sigma B is inactive during logarithmic growth unless the rsbW product is absent; (iv) the rsbX, rsbV, and rsbW products have a hierarchical order of action; and (v) both the rsbV and rsbW products appear to regulate sigma B activity posttranslationally. There are likely to be at least two routes by which information can enter the system to regulate sigma B: via the rsbX product, and via the rsbV and rsbW products.},

Both in its varied natural habitats and in industrial settings, B. licheniformis cells will be exposed to increases in the external osmolarity, conditions that trigger water efflux, impair turgor, cause the cessation of growth, and negatively affect the productivity of cell factories in biotechnological processes. We have taken here both systems-wide and targeted physiological approaches to unravel the core of the osmostress responses of B. licheniformis. Cells were suddenly subjected to an osmotic upshift of considerable magnitude (with 1 M NaCl), and their transcriptional profile was then recorded in a time-resolved fashion on a genome-wide scale. A bioinformatics cluster analysis was used to group the osmotically up-regulated genes into categories that are functionally associated with the synthesis and import of osmostress-relieving compounds (compatible solutes), the SigB-controlled general stress response, and genes whose functional annotation suggests that salt stress triggers secondary oxidative stress responses in B. licheniformis. The data set focusing on the transcriptional profile of B. licheniformis was enriched by proteomics aimed at identifying those proteins that were accumulated by the cells through increased biosynthesis in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, these global approaches were augmented by a set of experiments that addressed the synthesis of the compatible solutes proline and glycine betaine and assessed the growth-enhancing effects of various osmoprotectants. Combined, our data provide a blueprint of the cellular adjustment processes of B. licheniformis to both sudden and sustained osmotic stress.},

First, this study would contribute to understanding the distribution of the sigma B general stress system among Gram-positive bacteria. Second, a phylogenetic comparison of regulatory systems can supplement genetic and biochemical analysis by revealing conserved features that are critical for function. We report here that (1) B. licheniformis cells contain a protein that closely resembles B. subtilis sigma B in size and antigenic properties; (2) the level of this potential sigma B homologue rapidly increases following environmental or energy stress; and (3) the B. licheniformis genome encodes a homologue of the sigB general stress operon, including the sigma B structural gene and seven rsb regulatory genes. Based on these results, B. licheniformis possesses a general stress system likely regulated by two coupled partner switching modules that sense and integrate the two broad classes of activating stress signals.},

	abstract = {Gene arrays containing all currently known open reading frames of Bacillus subtilis were used to examine the general stress response of Bacillus. By proteomics, transcriptional analysis, transposon mutagenesis, and consensus promoter-based screening, 75 genes had previously been described as ςB-dependent general stress genes. The present gene array-based analysis confirmed 62 of these already known general stress genes and detected 63 additional genes subject to control by the stress sigma factor ςB. At least 24 of these 125 ςB-dependent genes seemed to be subject to a second, ςB-independent stress induction mechanism. Therefore, this transcriptional profiling revealed almost four times as many regulon members as the proteomic approach, but failure of confirmation of all known members of the ςB regulon indicates that even this approach has not yet elucidated the entire regulon. Most of the ςB-dependent general stress proteins are probably located in the cytoplasm, but 25 contain at least one membrane-spanning domain, and at least 6 proteins appear to be secreted. The functions of most of the newly described genes are still unknown. However, their classification as ςB-dependent stress genes argues that their products most likely perform functions in stress management and help to provide the nongrowing cell with multiple stress resistance. A comprehensive screening program analyzing the multiple stress resistance of mutants with mutations in single stress genes is in progress. The first results of this program, showing the diminished salt resistance of yjbC and yjbD mutants compared to that of the wild type, are presented. Only a few new ςB-dependent proteins with already known functions were found, among them SodA, encoding a superoxide dismutase. In addition to analysis of the ςB-dependent general stress regulon, a comprehensive list of genes induced by heat, salt, or ethanol stress in a ςB-independent manner is presented. Perhaps the most interesting of the ςB-independent stress phenomena was the induction of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor ςW and its entire regulon by salt shock.},

	abstract = {Bacteria respond to diverse growth-limiting stresses by producing a large set of general stress proteins. In Bacillus subtilis and related Gram-positive pathogens, this response is governed by the sigma(B) transcription factor. To establish the range of cellular functions associated with the general stress response, we compared the transcriptional profiles of wild and mutant strains under conditions that induce sigma(B) activity. Macroarrays representing more than 3900 annotated reading frames of the B. subtilis genome were hybridized to (33)P-labelled cDNA populations derived from (i) wild-type and sigB mutant strains that had been subjected to ethanol stress; and (ii) a strain in which sigma(B) expression was controlled by an inducible promoter. On the basis of their significant sigma(B)-dependent expression in three independent experiments, we identified 127 genes as prime candidates for members of the sigma(B) regulon. Of these genes, 30 were known previously or inferred to be sigma(B) dependent by other means. To assist in the analysis of the 97 new genes, we constructed hidden Markov models (HMM) that identified possible sigma(B) recognition sequences preceding 21 of them. To test the HMM and to provide an independent validation of the hybridization experiments, we mapped the sigma(B)-dependent messages for seven representative genes. For all seven, the 5' end of the message lay near typical sigma(B) recognition sequences, and these had been predicted correctly by the HMM for five of the seven examples. Lastly, all 127 gene products were assigned to functional groups by considering their similarity to known proteins. Notably, products with a direct protective function were in the minority. Instead, the general stress response increased relative message levels for known or predicted regulatory proteins, for transporters controlling solute influx and efflux, including potential drug efflux pumps, and for products implicated in carbon metabolism, envelope function and macromolecular turnover.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress can have lethal consequences if organisms do not respond and remediate the damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. Bacterial species respond to oxidative stress by activating transcriptional profiles that include biochemical functions to reduce oxidized cellular components, regenerate pools of reducing molecules, and detoxify harmful metabolites. Interestingly, the general stress response in Gram positive bacteria controlled by SigB is induced by oxidative stress from reactive oxygen and electrophilic species. The upregulation of SigB regulated genes during exposure to electrophilic and oxidative compounds suggests SigB contributes directly to the adaptations required for oxidative stress survival. A subset of the functions of SigB regulated genes can be categorized with antioxidant biochemical activities, such as redoxins, reductases and dehydrogenases, including regulation of low molecular weight thiols, yet their exact cellular role is not fully understood. Here, we present an overview of the predicted antioxidant biochemical functions regulated by SigB, with potential for biomedical research given the prevalence of oxidative stress during bacterial infection, as well as during industrial applications of large-scale production of compounds by microbes.},

The activity of SigB itself is tightly regulated by a complex signal transduction cascade with at least three main signaling pathways that respond to environmental stress, energy depletion, or low temperature. The SigB-dependent response is conserved in related gram-positive bacteria but is missing in strictly anaerobic or in some facultatively anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. It covers functions from nonspecific and multiple stress resistance to the control of virulence in pathogenic bacteria.

The results obtained indicated that out of all isolates, three strains could produce the bioactive compounds. The isolates were molecular (16SrRNA) identified as Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacterium Culaeen. Furthermore, structural analysis of the bioactive compounds was carried out in order to achieve maximum information concerning to them. The results obtained illustrated the existence of glycoprotein in all the bioactive compounds. Although, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillusniger and Mucor…. were sensitive to all the bioactive compounds, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were resistant to them. In addition, the bioactive compound producing isolated strains by Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis showed antifungal activity against Aspergillusniger and mucor sp. In total, our finding illustrated that the maharlu salt lake might be considered a source of halophilic bacteria with potent activity for production of the bioactive compounds. In addition, isolation and characterization of these compounds culminate in the achievement of the new drugs.},

We report the isolation and characterization of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase bacterium Bacillus licheniformis HSW-16 capable of ameliorating salt (NaCl) stress in wheat plants. The bacterium was isolated from water of Sambhar salt lake, Rajasthan, India. The presence of ACC deaminase activity was confirmed by enzyme assay and analysis of AcdS gene, a structural gene for ACC deaminase. Inoculation of B. licheniformis HSW-16 protected wheat plants from growth inhibition caused by NaCl and increased plant growth (6-38\%) in terms of root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight. Ionic analysis of plant samples showed that the bacterial inoculation decreased accumulation of Na+ content (51\%), and increased K+ (68\%), and Ca2+ content (32\%) in plants at different concentration of NaCl. It suggested that bacterial inoculation protected plants from the effect of NaCl by decreasing level of Na+ in plants. Production of exopolysaccharide by the B. licheniformis HSW-16 can also protect from Na+ by binding this ion. Moreover, application of test isolate resulted in an increase in certain osmolytes such as total soluble sugar, total protein content and a decrease in malondialdehyde content, illustrating their role in the protection of plants. The ability of B. licheniformis HSW-16 to colonize plant root surface was examined by staining the bacterium with acridine orange followed by fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA fingerprinting analysis. These results suggested that B. licheniformis HSW-16 could be used as a bioinoculant to improve the productivity of plants growing under salt stress.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis is the best studied Gram-positive bacterium, primarily as a model of cell differentiation and industrial exploitation. To date, little is known about the virulence of B. subtilis. In this study, we examined the virulence potential of a B. subtilis strain (G7) isolated from the Iheya North hydrothermal field of Okinawa Trough. G7 is aerobic, motile, endospore-forming, and requires NaCl for growth. The genome of G7 is composed of one circular chromosome of 4,216,133 base pairs with an average GC content of 43.72\%. G7 contains 4,416 coding genes, 27.5\% of which could not be annotated, and the remaining 72.5\% were annotated with known or predicted functions in 25 different COG categories. Ten sets of 23S, 5S, and 16S ribosomal RNA operons, 86 tRNA and 14 sRNA genes, 50 tandem repeats, 41 mini-satellites, one microsatellite, and 42 transposons were identified in G7. Comparing to the genome of the B. subtilis wild type strain NCIB 3610T, G7 genome contains many genomic translocations, inversions, and insertions, and twice the amount of genomic Islands (GIs), with 42.5\% of GI genes encoding hypothetical proteins. G7 possesses abundant putative virulence genes associated with adhesion, invasion, dissemination, anti-phagocytosis, and intracellular survival. Experimental studies showed that G7 was able to cause mortality in fish and mice following intramuscular/intraperitoneal injection, resist the killing effect of serum complement, and replicate in mouse macrophages and fish peripheral blood leukocytes. Taken together, our study indicates that G7 is a B. subtilis isolate with unique genetic features and can be lethal to vertebrate animals once being introduced into the animals by artificial means. These results provide the first insight into the potential harmfulness of deep-sea B. subtilis.},

	abstract = {Bacteria from the Bacillus group are microorganisms that inhabit a large number of different habitats. They are well known as producers of a wide array of antagonistic compounds of different structures, having between 5 to 8\% of the total genome devoted to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most important bioactive molecules from the genus Bacillus are non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and lipopeptides, polyketide compounds, bacteriocins and siderophores. Lipopeptides from Bacillus have very complex mechanisms of biosynthesis catalyzed by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), large enzyme complexes with modular structure, with each module being in charge for the incorporation of a particular amino acid. In general, they have a broad spectrum of antagonistic activity against plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses. Most important molecules from this group, circular lipopeptides from surfactin, iturin and fengycin families affect the target cells on the membrane level. Bacillus strains exhibit their biocontrol capacity predominantly through inhibitory activity on the growth of plant pathogens, as well as inducing systemic resistance in plants and competing for ecological niches with plant pathogens. Our previous studies showed the presence of multiple biosynthetic operons for synthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides in the collection of natural isolates of Bacillus, with many strains having more than one of them. Several strains of Bacillus sp. that we have recently characterized showed very strong antibacterial and antifungal activity against phytopathogens. The PCR analysis showed the presence of biosynthetic operons for iturin, bacillomycin, fengycin and surfactin in tested strains. Measurement of the kinetics of production of antimicrobial substances showed that, in most cases, synthesis started at the beginning of exponential phase of growth, reaching the maximum of antimicrobial activity at the beginning of the stationary growth phase and stayed at this level for the whole duration of observed period. Preparations of cell-free supernatants of tested strains were active against many fungal and bacterial pathogens, in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and HPTLC bioautography analysis of purified compounds confirmed the presence of lipopeptides of mentioned families, hence confirming the biocontrol capacity of Bacillus isolates.},

Until Feb. 2017, the phylum Firmicutes consisted of seven classes (Bacilli, Clostridia, Erysipelotrichia, Limnochordia, Negativicutes, Thermolithobacteria, and Tissierellia), 13 orders, 45 families, and 421 genera. Firmicutes species isolated from various environments in Korea have been reported from 2000, and 187 species have been approved as of Feb. 2017. All Firmicutes species were affiliated with three classes (Bacilli, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia), four orders (Bacillales, Lactobacillales, Clostridiales, and Erysipelotrichales), 17 families, and 54 genera. A total of 173 species belong to the class Bacilli, of which 151 species were affiliated with the order Bacillales and the remaining 22 species with the order Lactobacillales. Twelve species belonging to the class Clostridia were affiliated within only one order, Clostridiales. The most abundant family was Bacillaceae (67 species), followed by the family Paenibacillaceae (56 species). Thirteen novel genera were created using isolates from the Korean environment. A number of Firmicutes species were isolated from natural environments in Korean territory. In addition, a considerable number of species were isolated from artificial resources such as fermented foods. Most Firmicutes species, belonging to the families Bacillaceae, Planococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae, isolated from Korean fermented foods and solar salterns were halophilic or halotolerant. Firmicutes species were isolated from the whole territory of Korea, especially large numbers from Provinces Gyeonggi, Chungnam, and Daejeon.},

	abstract = {Biosurfactants (BS) are surface-active molecules produced by microorganisms. For several decades they have attracted interest as promising alternatives to current petroleum-based surfactants. Aside from their green profile, they have remarkably low critical micelle concentrations, reduce the air/water surface tension to very low levels and are excellent emulsifiers, all of which make them comparable or superior to their synthetic counterparts. These remarkable physical properties derive from their more complex chemical structures in which hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are not as clearly separated as chemical surfactants but have a more mosaic distribution of polarity as well as branched or circular structures. This allows the lipopeptide surfactin to adopt spherical structures to facilitate dense packing at interfaces. They are also more complex. Glycolipid BS, e.g. rhamnolipids (RL) and sophorolipids, are produced biologically as mixtures which vary in the size and saturation of the hydrophobic region as well as modifications in the hydrophilic headgroup, such as the number of sugar groups and different levels of acetylation, leading to variable surface-active properties. Their amphiphilicity allows RL to insert easily into membranes at sub-cmc concentrations to modulate membrane structure and extract lipopolysaccharides, leading to extensive biofilm remodeling in vivo, sometimes in collaboration with hydrophobic RL precursors. Thanks to their mosaicity, even anionic BS like RL only bind weakly to proteins and show much lower denaturing potency, even supporting membrane protein refolding. Nevertheless, they can promote protein degradation by proteases e.g. by neutralizing positive charges, which together with their biofilm-combating properties makes them very promising detergent surfactants.

	abstract = {In this work, we investigated how a combination of ethanol and high temperature (70°C), affect the properties of the inner membrane of Bacillus subtilis spores. We observed membrane permeabilization for ethanol concentrations ≥50\%, as indicated by the staining of the spores' DNA by the cell impermeable dye Propidium Iodide. The loss of membrane integrity was also confirmed by a decrease in the peak corresponding to dipicolinic acid using infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the spore refractivity (as measured by phase contrast microscopy) was decreased after the ethanol-heat treatment, suggesting a partial rehydration of the protoplast. Previously we have used fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) combined with the fluorescent molecular rotor Bodipy-C12 to study the microscopic viscosity in the inner membrane of B. subtilis spores, and showed that at normal conditions it is characterized by a very high viscosity. Here we demonstrate that the ethanol/high temperature treatment led to a decrease of the viscosity of the inner membrane, from 1000cP to 860cP for wild type spores at 50\% of ethanol. Altogether, our present work confirms the deleterious effect of ethanol on the structure of B. subtilis spores, as well as demonstrates the ability of FLIM — Bodipy-C12 to measure changes in the microviscosity of the spores upon perturbation.},

Reinforcement of the membrane with more complex lipid components is thus thought to be beneficial for the generation of more tolerant organisms. In this study, organisms with more complex membranes, namely, archaea, did not maintain high growth rates upon exposure to alcohols, indicating that more complex lipids do not necessarily fortify the membrane against the fluidizing effects of alcohols. In the presence of alcohols, shifts in lipid composition to more saturated and unbranched lipids were observed in most of the organisms tested, including archaea, yeasts, and bacteria. However, these shifts did not always result in a decrease in membrane fluidity or in greater tolerance of the organism to alcohol exposure. In general, organisms tolerating the highest concentrations of alcohols maintained membrane fluidity after alcohol exposure, whereas organisms that increased membrane rigidity were less tolerant. Altered lipid composition was a common response to alcohol exposure, with the most tolerant organisms maintaining a modestly fluid membrane. Our results demonstrate that increased membrane fluidity is not the sole cause of growth inhibition and that alcohols may also denature proteins within the membrane and cytosol, adversely affecting metabolism and decreasing cell growth.},

This tactic behavior became one of the most-studied model systems for signal transduction and quantitative biology, and underlying molecular mechanisms are well characterized in Escherichia coli and several other model bacteria. In this review, we focus primarily on less understood aspect of bacterial chemotaxis, namely its physiological relevance for individual bacterial cells and for bacterial populations. As evident from multiple recent studies, even for the same bacterial species flagellar motility and chemotaxis might serve multiple roles, depending on the physiological and environmental conditions. Among these, finding sources of nutrients and more generally locating niches that are optimal for growth appear to be one of the major functions of bacterial chemotaxis, which could explain many chemoeffector preferences as well as flagellar gene regulation. Chemotaxis might also generally enhance efficiency of environmental colonization by motile bacteria, which involves intricate interplay between individual and collective behaviors and trade-offs between growth and motility. Finally, motility and chemotaxis play multiple roles in collective behaviors of bacteria including swarming, biofilm formation and autoaggregation, as well as in their interactions with animal and plant hosts.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-10-641},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of specific genes and gene expression patterns important for bacterial survival, transmission and pathogenesis is critically needed to enable development of more effective pathogen control strategies. The stationary phase stress response transcriptome, including many sigmaB-dependent genes, was defined for the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Specifically, bacterial transcriptomes were compared between stationary phase cells of L. monocytogenes 10403S and an otherwise isogenic DeltasigB mutant, which does not express the alternative sigma factor sigmaB, a major regulator of genes contributing to stress response, including stresses encountered upon entry into stationary phase.
RESULTS: Overall, 83\% of all L. monocytogenes genes were transcribed in stationary phase cells; 42\% of currently annotated L. monocytogenes genes showed medium to high transcript levels under these conditions. A total of 96 genes had significantly higher transcript levels in 10403S than in DeltasigB, indicating sigmaB-dependent transcription of these genes. RNA-Seq analyses indicate that a total of 67 noncoding RNA molecules (ncRNAs) are transcribed in stationary phase L. monocytogenes, including 7 previously unrecognized putative ncRNAs. Application of a dynamically trained Hidden Markov Model, in combination with RNA-Seq data, identified 65 putative sigmaB promoters upstream of 82 of the 96 sigmaB-dependent genes and upstream of the one sigmaB-dependent ncRNA. The RNA-Seq data also enabled annotation of putative operons as well as visualization of 5'- and 3'-UTR regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from these studies provide powerful evidence that RNA-Seq data combined with appropriate bioinformatics tools allow quantitative characterization of prokaryotic transcriptomes, thus providing exciting new strategies for exploring transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria.},

	abstract = {Among Listeria monocytogenes' four alternative σ factors, σB controls the largest regulon. As σB-dependent transcription of some genes may be masked by overlaps among regulons, and as some σB-dependent genes are expressed only under very specific conditions, we hypothesized that the σB regulon is not yet fully defined. To further extend our understanding of the σB regulon, we used RNA-seq to identify σB-dependent genes in an L. monocytogenes strain that expresses σB following rhamnose induction, and in which genes encoding the other alternative sigma factors have been deleted. Analysis of RNA-seq data with multiple bioinformatics approaches, including a sliding window method that detects differentially transcribed 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), identified 105 σB-dependent transcription units (TUs) comprising 201 genes preceded by σB-dependent promoters. Of these 105 TUs, 7 TUs comprising 15 genes had not been identified previously as σB-dependent. An additional 23 genes not reported previously as σB-dependent were identified in 9 previously recognized σB-dependent TUs. Overall, 38 of these 201 genes had not been identified previously as members of the L. monocytogenes σB regulon. These newly identified σB-dependent genes encode proteins annotated as being involved in transcriptional regulation, oxidative and osmotic stress response, and in metabolism of energy, carbon and nucleotides. In total, 18 putative σB-dependent promoters were newly identified. Interestingly, a number of genes previously identified as σB-dependent did not show significant evidence for σB-dependent transcription in our experiments. Based on promoter analyses, a number of these genes showed evidence for co-regulation by σB and other transcriptional factors, suggesting that some σB-dependent genes require additional transcriptional regulators along with σB for transcription. Over-expression of a single alternative sigma factor in the absence of all other alternative sigma factors allowed us to: (i) identify new σB-dependent functions in L. monocytogenes, such as regulation of genes involved in 1,2-propanediol utilization (LMRG\_00594-LMRG\_00611) and biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides (LMRG\_00978-LMRG\_00985); and (ii) identify new σB-dependent genes involved in stress response and pathogenesis functions. These data further support that σB not only regulates stress response functions, but also plays a broad role in L. monocytogenes homeostasis and resilience.},

However, how this bacterium switches from a saprophyte to a pathogen is largely unknown. Here, using tiling arrays and RNAs from wild-type and mutant bacteria grown in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, we have analysed the transcription of its entire genome. We provide the complete Listeria operon map and have uncovered far more diverse types of RNAs than expected: in addition to 50 small RNAs ({\textless}500 nucleotides), at least two of which are involved in virulence in mice, we have identified antisense RNAs covering several open-reading frames and long overlapping 5' and 3' untranslated regions. We discovered that riboswitches can act as terminators for upstream genes. When Listeria reaches the host intestinal lumen, an extensive transcriptional reshaping occurs with a SigB-mediated activation of virulence genes. In contrast, in the blood, PrfA controls transcription of virulence genes. Remarkably, several non-coding RNAs absent in the non-pathogenic species Listeria innocua exhibit the same expression patterns as the virulence genes. Together, our data unravel successive and coordinated global transcriptional changes during infection and point to previously unknown regulatory mechanisms in bacteria.},

	abstract = {σ(B) is an alternative σ factor that regulates stress response and virulence genes in the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. To gain further insight into σ(B)-dependent regulatory mechanisms in L. monocytogenes, we (i) performed quantitative proteomic comparisons between the L. monocytogenes parent strain 10403S and an isogenic ΔsigB mutant and (ii) conducted a meta-analysis of published microarray studies on the 10403S σ(B) regulon. A total of 134 genes were found to be significantly positively regulated by σ(B) at the transcriptomic level with {\textgreater}75 \% of these genes preceded by putative σ(B)-dependent promoters; 21 of these 134 genes were also found to be positively regulated by σ(B) through proteomics. In addition, 15 proteins were only found to be positively regulated by σ(B) through proteomics analyses, including Lmo1349, a putative glycine cleavage system protein. The lmo1349 gene is preceded by a 5' UTR that functions as a glycine riboswitch, which suggests regulation of glycine metabolism by σ(B) in L. monocytogenes. Herein, we propose a model where σ(B) upregulates pathways that facilitate biosynthesis and uptake of glycine, which may then activate this riboswitch. Our data also (i) identified a number of σ(B)-dependent proteins that appear to be encoded by genes that are co-regulated by multiple transcriptional regulators, in particular PrfA, and (ii) found σ(B)-dependent genes and proteins to be overrepresented in the 'energy metabolism' role category, highlighting contributions of the σ(B) regulon to L. monocytogenes energy metabolism as well as a role of PrfA and σ(B) interaction in regulating aspects of energy metabolism in L. monocytogenes.},

In the present study we investigated the impact of a sigB deletion on the proteome of L. monocytogenes grown in a chemically defined medium both in the presence and in the absence of osmotic stress (0.5 M NaCl). Two new phenotypes associated with the sigB deletion were identified using this medium. (i) Unexpectedly, the strain with the DeltasigB deletion was found to grow faster than the parent strain in the growth medium, but only when 0.5 M NaCl was present. This phenomenon was independent of the carbon source provided in the medium. (ii) The DeltasigB mutant was found to have unusual Gram staining properties compared to the parent, suggesting that sigma(B) contributes to the maintenance of an intact cell wall. A proteomic analysis was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, using cells growing in the exponential and stationary phases. Overall, 11 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the wild type and the DeltasigB mutant; 10 of these proteins were expressed at lower levels in the mutant, and 1 was overexpressed in the mutant. All 11 proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, and putative functions were assigned based on homology to proteins from other bacteria. Five proteins had putative functions related to carbon utilization (Lmo0539, Lmo0783, Lmo0913, Lmo1830, and Lmo2696), while three proteins were similar to proteins whose functions are unknown but that are known to be stress inducible (Lmo0796, Lmo2391, and Lmo2748). To gain further insight into the role of sigma(B) in L. monocytogenes, we deleted the genes encoding four of the proteins, lmo0796, lmo0913, lmo2391, and lmo2748. Phenotypic characterization of the mutants revealed that Lmo2748 plays a role in osmotolerance, while Lmo0796, Lmo0913, and Lmo2391 were all implicated in acid stress tolerance to various degrees. Invasion assays performed with Caco-2 cells indicated that none of the four genes was required for mammalian cell invasion. Microscopic analysis suggested that loss of Lmo2748 might contribute to the cell wall defect observed in the DeltasigB mutant. Overall, this study highlighted two new phenotypes associated with the loss of sigma(B). It also demonstrated clear roles for sigma(B) in both osmotic and low-pH stress tolerance and identified specific components of the sigma(B) regulon that contribute to the responses observed.},

	abstract = {Sigma factors provide promoter recognition specificity to RNA polymerase holoenzyme, contribute to DNA strand separation, and then dissociate from the core enzyme following transcription initiation. As the regulon of a single sigma factor can be composed of hundreds of genes, sigma factors can provide effective mechanisms for simultaneously regulating expression of large numbers of prokaryotic genes. One newly emerging field is identification of the specific roles of alternative sigma factors in regulating expression of virulence genes and virulence-associated genes in bacterial pathogens. Virulence genes encode proteins whose functions are essential for the bacterium to effectively establish an infection in a host organism. In contrast, virulence-associated genes can contribute to bacterial survival in the environment and therefore may enhance the capacity of the bacterium to spread to new individuals or to survive passage through a host organism. As alternative sigma factors have been shown to regulate expression of both virulence and virulence-associated genes, these proteins can contribute both directly and indirectly to bacterial virulence. Sigma factors are classified into two structurally unrelated families, the sigma70 and the sigma54 families. The sigma70 family includes primary sigma factors (e.g., Bacillus subtilis sigma(A)) as well as related alternative sigma factors; sigma54 forms a distinct subfamily of sigma factors referred to as sigma(N) in almost all species for which these proteins have been characterized to date. We present several examples of alternative sigma factors that have been shown to contribute to virulence in at least one organism. For each sigma factor, when applicable, examples are drawn from multiple species.},

	abstract = {Sensing and responding to environmental cues is critical for the adaptability and success of the food-borne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. A supramolecular multi-protein complex known as the stressosome, which acts as a stress sensing hub, is responsible for orchestrating the activation of a signal transduction pathway resulting in the activation of σB, the sigma factor that controls the general stress response (GSR). When σB is released from the anti-sigma factor RsbW, a rapid up-regulation of the large σB regulon, comprised of ≥ 300 genes, ensures that cells respond appropriately to the new environmental conditions. A diversity of stresses including low pH, high osmolarity, and blue light are known to be sensed by the stressosome, resulting in a generalized increase in stress resistance. Appropriate activation of the stressosome and deployment of σB are critical to fitness as there is a trade-off between growth and stress protection when the GSR is deployed. We review the recent developments in this field and describe an up-to-date model of how this sensory organelle might integrate environmental signals to produce an appropriate activation of the GSR. Some of the outstanding questions and challenges in this fascinating field are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is a highly adaptable organism that can persist in a wide range of environmental and food-related niches. The consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat foods can cause infections, termed listeriosis, in vulnerable humans, particularly those with weakened immune systems. Although these infections are comparatively rare they are associated with high mortality rates and therefore this pathogen has a significant impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt to and survive a wide range of stress conditions including low pH, low water activity, and low temperature, which makes it problematic for food producers who rely on these stresses for preservation. Stress tolerance in L. monocytogenes can be explained partially by the presence of the general stress response (GSR), a transcriptional response under the control of the alternative sigma factor sigma B (σB) that reconfigures gene transcription to provide homeostatic and protective functions to cope with the stress. Within the host σB also plays a key role in surviving the harsh conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. As the infection progresses beyond the GI tract L. monocytogenes uses an intracellular infectious cycle to propagate, spread and remain protected from the host’s humoral immunity. Many of the virulence genes that facilitate this infectious cycle are under the control of a master transcriptional regulator called PrfA. In this review we consider the environmental reservoirs that enable L. monocytogenes to gain access to the food chain and discuss the stresses that the pathogen must overcome to survive and grow in these environments. The overlap that exists between stress tolerance and virulence is described. We review the principal measures that are used to control the pathogen and point to exciting new approaches that might provide improved means of control in the future.},

Our previous studies showed that root colonization is contributed by the ability of the bacterium to efficiently utilize carbon sources and form biofilms and that the sodA2 gene-encoded manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD2) plays an indispensable role in the survival of B. cereus 905 in the wheat rhizosphere. In this investigation, we further demonstrated that the ability of B. cereus 905 to resist adverse environmental conditions is partially attributed to activation of the alternative sigma factor σB, encoded by the sigB gene. The sigB mutant experienced a dramatic reduction in survival when cells were exposed to ethanol, acid, heat, and oxidative stress or under glucose starvation. Analysis of the sodA2 gene transcription revealed a partial, σB-dependent induction of the gene during glucose starvation or when treated with paraquat. In addition, the sigB mutant displayed a defect in biofilm formation under stress conditions. Finally, results from the root colonization assay indicated that sigB and sodA2 collectively contribute to B. cereus 905 colonization on wheat roots. Our study suggests a diverse role of SigB in rhizosphere survival and root colonization of B. cereus 905 under stress conditions.},

These proteins were not detected in strain 0075-95. Inhibition of protein synthesis in Vero cells was used as a measure of cytotoxicity. The HBL complex from strain F837-76 was highly toxic.

Both complexes purified from strain 1230-88 were cytotoxic. The amount required to cause the same degree of cytotoxicity was approximately equal for the components of the two complexes, except that higher amounts of the 105 kDa protein of NHE had to be present than for the other components.

A commonly used hurdle is low pH which allows the decrease in bacterial growth rate but also the inactivation of pathogens or spoilage microorganisms. Bacillus cereus is a well-known food-borne pathogen leading to economical and safety issues in food industry. Because survival mechanisms implemented will allow bacteria to cope with environmental changes, it is important to provide understanding of B. cereus stress response. Thus this review deals with the adaptive traits of B. cereus cells facing to acid stress conditions. The acid stress response of B. cereus could be divided into four groups (i) general stress response (ii) pH homeostasis, (iii) metabolic modifications and alkali production and (iv) secondary oxidative stress response. This current knowledge may be useful to understand how B. cereus cells may cope to acid environment such as encountered in food products and thus to find some molecular biomarkers of the bacterial behavior. These biomarkers could be furthermore used to develop new microbial behavior prediction tools which can provide insights into underlying molecular physiological states which govern the behavior of microorganisms and thus opening the avenue toward the detection of stress adaptive behavior at an early stage and the control of stress-induced resistance throughout the food chain.},

In bacteria, these adaptive responses are generally mediated by two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR). With the use of in silico techniques, a complete set of HKs and RRs was recovered from eight completely sequenced B. cereus group genomes. By applying a bidirectional best-hits method combined with gene neighbourhood analysis, a footprint of these proteins was made. Around 40 HK-RR gene pairs were detected in each member of the B. cereus group. In addition, each member contained many HK and RR genes not encoded in pairs ("orphans"). Classification of HKs and RRs based on their enzymic domains together with the analysis of two neighbour-joining trees of these domains revealed putative interaction partners for most of the "orphans". Putative biological functions, including involvement in virulence and host-microbe interactions, were predicted for the B. cereus group HKs and RRs by comparing them with those of B. subtilis and other micro-organisms. Remarkably, B. anthracis appeared to lack specific HKs and RRs and was found to contain many truncated, putatively non-functional, HK and RR genes. It is hypothesized that specialization of B. anthracis as a pathogen could have reduced the range of environmental stimuli to which it is exposed. This may have rendered some of its TCSs obsolete, ultimately resulting in the deletion of some HK and RR genes.},

	abstract = {Background
The Bacillus cereus sensu lato group currently includes seven species (B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. thuringiensis, B. weihenstephanensis and B. cytotoxicus) that recent phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses suggest are likely a single species, despite their varied phenotypes. Although horizontal gene transfer and insertion-deletion events are clearly important for promoting divergence among these genomes, recent studies have demonstrated that a major basis for phenotypic diversity in these organisms may be differential regulation of the highly similar gene content shared by these organisms. To explore this hypothesis, we used an in silico approach to evaluate the relationship of pathogenic potential and the divergence of the SigB-dependent general stress response within the B. cereus sensu lato group, since SigB has been demonstrated to support pathogenesis in Bacillus, Listeria and Staphylococcus species.

Results
During the divergence of these organisms from a common “SigB-less” ancestor, the placement of SigB promoters at varied locations in the B. cereus sensu lato genomes predict alternative structures for the SigB regulon in different organisms. Predicted promoter changes suggesting differential transcriptional control of a common gene pool predominate over evidence of indels or horizontal gene transfer for explaining SigB regulon divergence.

Conclusions
Four lineages of the SigB regulon have arisen that encompass different gene contents and suggest different strategies for supporting pathogenesis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that divergence within the B. cereus sensu lato group rests in part on alternative strategies for regulation of a common gene pool.},

Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that the shift from extrahost environments to the host gastrointestinal tract and, subsequently, to intracellular environments requires regulatory interplay between σB and PrfA at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and protein activity levels. Here, we review the current evidence for cross talk and interplay between σB and PrfA and their respective regulons and highlight the plasticity of σB and PrfA cross talk and the role of this cross talk in facilitating successful transition of L. monocytogenes from diverse extrahost to diverse extra- and intracellular host environments.},

	abstract = {The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is a highly adaptable organism that can persist in a wide range of environmental and food-related niches. The consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat foods can cause infections, termed listeriosis, in vulnerable humans, particularly those with weakened immune systems. Although these infections are comparatively rare they are associated with high mortality rates and therefore this pathogen has a significant impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt to and survive a wide range of stress conditions including low pH, low water activity, and low temperature, which makes it problematic for food producers who rely on these stresses for preservation. Stress tolerance in L. monocytogenes can be explained partially by the presence of the general stress response (GSR), a transcriptional response under the control of the alternative sigma factor sigma B (σB) that reconfigures gene transcription to provide homeostatic and protective functions to cope with the stress. Within the host σB also plays a key role in surviving the harsh conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. As the infection progresses beyond the GI tract L. monocytogenes uses an intracellular infectious cycle to propagate, spread and remain protected from the host’s humoral immunity. Many of the virulence genes that facilitate this infectious cycle are under the control of a master transcriptional regulator called PrfA. In this review we consider the environmental reservoirs that enable L. monocytogenes to gain access to the food chain and discuss the stresses that the pathogen must overcome to survive and grow in these environments. The overlap that exists between stress tolerance and virulence is described. We review the principal measures that are used to control the pathogen and point to exciting new approaches that might provide improved means of control in the future.},

In the current communication we studied the recovery and outgrowth of individually sorted spores in BHI and rice broth media and on agar plates using flow cytometry. We show that recovery of wet heat treated Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 spores is affected by matrix composition with highest recovery in BHI broth or on rice agar plates, compared to BHI agar plates and rice broth. Data show that not only media composition but also its liquid or solid state affect the recovery of heat treated spores. To determine the impact of factors with putative roles in recovery of heat treated spores, specific genes previously shown to be highly expressed in outgrowing heat-treated spores were selected for mutant construction. Spores of nine B. cereus ATCC 14579 deletion mutants were obtained and their recovery from wet heat treatment was evaluated using BHI and rice broth and agar plates. Deletion mutant spores showed different capacity to recover from heat treatment compared to wild type with the most pronounced effect for a mutant lacking BC5242, a gene encoding a membrane protein with C2C2 zinc finger which resulted in over 95\% reduction in recovery compared to the wild type in BHI broth. Notably, similar relative performance of wild type and mutants was observed using the other recovery conditions. We obtained insights on the impact of matrix composition and state on recovery of individually sorted heat treated spores and identified cellular factors with putative roles in this process. These results may provide leads for future developments in design of more efficient combined preservation treatments.},

Mechanisms by which the Psp system detects the stress signal and responds have so far remained undetermined. Here we demonstrate that PspA and PspG directly confront a variety of inducing stimuli by switching the cell to anaerobic respiration and fermentation and by down-regulating motility, thereby subtly adjusting and maintaining energy usage and pmf. Additionally, PspG controls iron usage. We show that the Psp-inducing protein IV secretin stress, in the absence of Psp proteins, decreases the pmf in an ArcB-dependent manner and that ArcB is required for amplifying and transducing the stress signal to the PspF regulon. The requirement of the ArcB signal transduction protein for induction of psp provides clear evidence for a direct link between the physiological redox state of the cell, the electron transport chain, and induction of the Psp response. Under normal growth conditions PspA and PspD control the level of activity of ArcB/ArcA system that senses the redox/metabolic state of the cell, whereas under stress conditions PspA, PspD, and PspG deliver their effector functions at least in part by activating ArcB/ArcA through positive feedback.},

	abstract = {The phage shock protein (psp) operon of Escherichia coli is strongly induced in response to heat, ethanol, osmotic shock, and infection by filamentous bacteriophages. The operon contains at least four genes--pspA, pspB, pspC, and pspE--and is regulated at the transcriptional level. We report here that psp expression is controlled by a network of positive and negative regulatory factors and that transcription in response to all inducing agents is directed by the sigma-factor sigma 54. Negative regulation is mediated by both PspA and the sigma 32-dependent heat shock proteins. The PspB and PspC proteins cooperatively activate expression, possibly by antagonizing the PspA-controlled repression. The strength of this activation is determined primarily by the concentration of PspC, whereas PspB enhances but is not absolutely essential for PspC-dependent expression. PspC is predicted to contain a leucine zipper, a motif responsible for the dimerization of many eukaryotic transcriptional activators. PspB and PspC, though not necessary for psp expression during heat shock, are required for the strong psp response to phage infection, osmotic shock, and ethanol treatment. The psp operon thus represents a third category of transcriptional control mechanisms, in addition to the sigma 32- and sigma E-dependent systems, for genes induced by heat and other stresses.},

Interest in the Psp system has increased significantly in recent years due to appreciation that Psp-like proteins are found in all three domains of life and because the bacterial Psp response has been linked to virulence and other important phenotypes. In this article, we summarize our current understanding of what the Psp system detects and how it detects it, how four core Psp proteins form a signal transduction cascade between the IM and the cytoplasm, and current ideas that explain how the Psp response keeps bacterial cells alive. Although recent studies have significantly improved our understanding of this system, it is an understanding that is still far from complete.},

It is also an important cause of spoilage of food, in particular of milk and dairy-products. The growth and survival of B. cereus in food or during an infection is for a large part determined by to what extent the bacterium can adapt to changes in its environment. This process is known as the stress response and the protein SigmaB has an important role in it. Stress in B. cereus leads to the rapid activation of SigmaB. Subsequently, SigmaB coordinates the transcription of a set of genes, which leads to an increased resistance to stress. For example, SigmaB contributes to the growth and survival of B. cereus at low and high temperatures. It also has a role in cellular metabolism, which may indirectly also contribute to stress resistance. The knowledge obtained on the role of SigmaB in the stress response of B. cereus may contribute to the development of new, efficient, and safe methods for the production of food.},

	abstract = {Ensuring food safety, particularly for vulnerable groups, like infants and young children, requires identifying and prioritizing potential hazards in food chains. We previously developed a web-based decision support system (DSS) to identify specific microbiological hazards (MHs) in infant and toddler foods through a structured five-step process. This study takes the framework further by introducing systematic risk ranking (RR) steps to rank MH risks with seven criteria: process survival, recontamination, growth opportunity, meal preparation, hazard-food association evidence, food consumption habits of infants and toddlers in the EU, and MH severity. Each criterion is given a semi-quantitative or quantitative score or risk value, contributing to the final MH risk calculation via three aggregation methods: semi-quantitative risk scoring, semi-quantitative risk value, and outranking multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). To validate the criteria and ranking approaches, we conducted a case study to rank MH risks in infant formula, compared the results of the three risk ranking methods, and additionally evaluated the ranking results against expert opinions to ensure their accuracy. The results showed strong agreement among the three methods, consistently ranking Salmonella non-Typhi and Cronobacter spp. and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli as the top MH risks in infant formulae, with minor deviations. When MHs were ranked after an initial hazard identification step, all three methods produced nearly identical MH rankings, reinforcing the reliability of the ranking steps and the selected criteria. Notably, the risk value and MCDA methods provided more informative MH rankings compared to the risk scoring method. The risk value and risk scoring methods were implemented into an online tool, called the MIcrobiological hazards risk RAnking decision support system (Mira-DSS), available at https://foodmicrobiologywur.shinyapps.io/MIcrobial\_hazards\_RAnking/. In conclusion, our framework enables the ranking of MH risks, facilitating intervention comparisons and resource allocations to mitigate MH risks in infant foods, with potential applicability to broader food categories.},

	abstract = {The ability to monitor the environment for toxic chemical and physical disturbances is essential for bacteria that live in dynamic environments. The fundamental sensing mechanisms and physiological responses that allow bacteria to thrive are conserved even if the molecular components of these pathways are not. The bacterial general stress response (GSR) represents a conceptual model for how one pathway integrates a wide range of environmental signals, and how a generalized system with broad molecular responses is coordinated to promote survival likely through complementary pathways. Environmental stress signals such as heat, osmotic stress, and pH changes are received by sensor proteins that through a signaling cascade activate the sigma factor, SigB, to regulate over 200 genes. Additionally, the GSR plays an important role in stress priming that increases bacterial fitness to unrelated subsequent stressors such as oxidative compounds. While the GSR response is implicated during oxidative stress, the reason for its activation remains unknown and suggests crosstalk between environmental and oxidative stress sensors and responses to coordinate antioxidant functions. Systems levels studies of cellular responses such as transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of stressed bacteria and single-cell analysis could shed light into the regulated functions that protect, remediate, and minimize damage during dynamic environments. This perspective will focus on fundamental stress sensing mechanisms and responses in Gram-positive bacterial species to illustrate their commonalities at the molecular and physiological levels; summarize exciting directions; and highlight how system-level approaches can help us understand bacterial physiology.},

	abstract = {Tight coupling of transcription and translation is considered a defining feature of bacterial gene expression1,2. The pioneering ribosome can both physically associate and kinetically coordinate with RNA polymerase (RNAP)3–11, forming a signal-integration hub for co-transcriptional regulation that includes translation-based attenuation12,13 and RNA quality control2. However, it remains unclear whether transcription–translation coupling—together with its broad functional consequences—is indeed a fundamental characteristic of bacteria other than Escherichia coli. Here we show that RNAPs outpace pioneering ribosomes in the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and that this ‘runaway transcription’ creates alternative rules for both global RNA surveillance and translational control of nascent RNA. In particular, uncoupled RNAPs in B. subtilis explain the diminished role of Rho-dependent transcription termination, as well as the prevalence of mRNA leaders that use riboswitches and RNA-binding proteins. More broadly, we identified widespread genomic signatures of runaway transcription in distinct phyla across the bacterial domain. Our results show that coupled RNAP–ribosome movement is not a general hallmark of bacteria. Instead, translation-coupled transcription and runaway transcription constitute two principal modes of gene expression that determine genome-specific regulatory mechanisms in prokaryotes.},

Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the recently developed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technique, the protein expression profiles of the wild type and an isogenic delta sigB deletion strain were compared. Overall, this study identified 38 proteins whose expression was sigmaB dependent; 17 of these proteins were found to require the presence of sigmaB for full expression, while 21 were expressed at a higher level in the delta sigB mutant background. The data obtained with the two proteomic approaches showed limited overlap (four proteins were identified by both methods), a finding that highlights the complementarity of the two technologies. Overall, the proteomic data reaffirmed a role for sigmaB in the general stress response and highlighted a probable role for sigmaB in metabolism, especially in the utilization of alternative carbon sources. Proteomic and physiological data revealed the involvement of sigmaB in glycerol metabolism. Five newly identified members of the sigmaB regulon were shown to be under direct regulation of sigmaB using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), while random amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was used to map four sigmaB-dependent promoters upstream from lmo0796, lmo1830, lmo2391, and lmo2695. Using RT-PCR analysis of known and newly identified sigmaB-dependent genes, as well as proteomic analyses, sigmaB was shown to play a major role in the stationary phase of growth in complex media.},

Here, we report the antagonistic interaction between Bacillus subtilis and the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium verticillioides We demonstrate that this bacterial-fungal interaction triggers the induction of the SigB transcription factor, the master regulator of B. subtilis stress adaptation. Dual-growth experiments performed with live or dead mycelia or culture supernatants of F. verticillioides showed that SigB was activated and required for the biocontrol of fungal growth. Mutations in the different regulatory pathways of SigB activation in the isogenic background revealed that only the energy-related RsbP-dependent arm of SigB activation was responsible for specific fungal detection and triggering the antagonistic response. The activation of SigB increased the expression of the operon responsible for the production of the antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide surfactin (the srfA operon). SigB-deficient B. subtilis cultures produced decreased amounts of surfactin, and B. subtilis cultures defective in surfactin production (ΔsrfA) were unable to control the growth of F. verticillioides In vivo experiments of seed germination efficiency and early plant growth inhibition in the presence of F. verticillioides confirmed the physiological importance of SigB activity for plant bioprotection.IMPORTANCE Biological control using beneficial bacteria (PGPRs) represents an attractive and environment-friendly alternative to pesticides for controlling plant diseases.

	abstract = {The general stress response and the decision-making processes of sporulation initiation are interconnected pathways in the regulatory network of Bacillus subtilis. In a previous study we provided evidence for a mechanism capable of impairing sporulation by σ(B) -dependent induction of spo0E, encoding a phosphatase specifically inactivating the sporulation master regulator Spo0A{\textasciitilde}P. Here we show that the σ(B) promoter (Pσ(B)) of spo0E is responsive to sub-inhibitory levels of ethanol stress, producing a σ(B) -dependent sporulation deficient phenotype. In addition to positive regulation by σ(B) , we identified Rok, the repressor of comK, to be a direct repressor of spo0E expression from Pσ(B) . This constellation provides the possibility to integrate signals negatively acting on sporulation initiation through the σ(B) branch as well as a positive feedback loop acting on Pσ(B) by Rok that is most likely a direct consequence of Spo0A{\textasciitilde}P activity. Thus, the molecular mechanism described here offers the opportunity for cross-talk between the general stress response and sporulation initiation in the adaptational gene expression network of B. subtilis.},

Here, we describe the identification of the set of σB-regulated genes in B. cereus by DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptome upon a mild heat shock. Twenty-four genes could be identified as being σB dependent as witnessed by (i) significantly lower expression levels of these genes in mutants with a deletion of sigB and rsbY (which encode the alternative sigma factor σB and a crucial positive regulator of σB activity, respectively) than in the parental strain B. cereus ATCC 14579 and (ii) increased expression of these genes upon a heat shock. Newly identified σB-dependent genes in B. cereus include a histidine kinase and two genes that have predicted functions in spore germination. This study shows that the σB regulon of B. cereus is considerably smaller than that of other gram-positive bacteria. This appears to be in line with phylogenetic analyses where σB of the B. cereus group was placed close to the ancestral form of σB in gram-positive bacteria. The data described in this study and previous studies in which the complete σB regulon of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined enabled a comparison of the sets of σB-regulated genes in the different gram-positive bacteria. This showed that only three genes (rsbV, rsbW, and sigB) are conserved in their σB dependency in all four bacteria, suggesting that the σB regulon of the different gram-positive bacteria has evolved to perform niche-specific functions.},

	abstract = {Mononuclear molybdoenzymes are highly versatile catalysts that occur in organisms in all domains of life, where they mediate essential cellular functions such as energy generation and detoxification reactions. Molybdoenzymes are particularly abundant in bacteria, where over 50 distinct types of enzymes have been identified to date. In bacterial pathogens, all aspects of molybdoenzyme biology such as molybdate uptake, cofactor biosynthesis and function of the enzymes themselves, have been shown to affect fitness in the host as well as virulence. Although current studies are mostly focused on a few key pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, some common themes for the function and adaptation of the molybdoenzymes to pathogen environmental niches are emerging. Firstly, for many of these enzymes, their role is in supporting bacterial energy generation; and the corresponding pathogen fitness and virulence defects appear to arise from a suboptimally poised metabolic network. Secondly, all substrates converted by virulence-relevant bacterial Mo enzymes belong to classes known to be generated in the host either during inflammation or as part of the host signaling network, with some enzyme groups showing adaptation to the increased conversion of such substrates. Lastly, a specific adaptation to bacterial in-host survival is an emerging link between the regulation of molybdoenzyme expression in bacterial pathogens and the presence of immune system-generated reactive oxygen species. The prevalence of molybdoenzymes in key bacterial pathogens including ESKAPE pathogens, paired with the mounting evidence of their central roles in bacterial fitness during infection, suggest that they could be important future drug targets.},

The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and aw, change with time.},

	abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to adapt to changing environments and gain cell robustness, challenges the prediction of their history-dependent behaviour. Using our model organism Bacillus cereus, a notorious Gram-positive food spoilage and pathogenic spore-forming bacterium, a strategy will be described that allows for identification of biomarkers for robustness. First an overview will be presented of its two-component systems that generally include a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator, allowing rapid and robust responses to fluctuations in the environment. The role of the multisensor hybrid kinase RsbK and the PP2C-type phosphatase RsbY system in activation of the general stress sigma factor σB is highlighted. An extensive comparative analysis of transcriptional landscapes derived from B. cereus exposed to mild stress conditions such as heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress, revealed that, amongst others σB regulated genes were induced in most conditions tested. The information derived from the transcriptome data was subsequently implemented in a framework for identifying and selecting cellular biomarkers at their mRNA, protein and/or activity level, for mild stressinduced microbial robustness towards lethal stresses. Exposure of unstressed and mild stress-adapted cells to subsequent lethal stress conditions (heat, acid and oxidative stress) allowed for quantification of the robustness advantage provided by mild stress pretreatment using the plate-count method. The induction levels of the selected candidate-biomarkers, σB protein, catalase activity and transcripts of certain proteases upon mild stress treatment, were significantly correlated to mild stress-induced enhanced robustness towards lethal thermal, oxidative and acid stresses, and were therefore suitable to predict these adaptive traits. Cellular biomarkers that are quantitatively correlated to adaptive behavior will facilitate our ability to predict the impact of adaptive behavior on cell robustness and will allow to control and/or exploit these adaptive traits. Extrapolation to other species and genera is discussed such as avenues towards mechanism-based design of microbial fitness and robustness.},

During pre-exposure to 42°C, B. cereus ATCC 14579 adapts to heat exposure at the lethal temperature of 50°C (maximum protection occurs after 15 min to 1 h of pre-exposure to 42°C). For this heat-adaptive response, de novo protein synthesis is required. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we observed 31 heat-induced proteins, and we determined the N-terminal sequences of a subset of these proteins. This revealed induction of stress proteins (CspB, CspE, and SodA), proteins involved in sporulation (SpoVG and AldA), metabolic enzymes (FolD and Dra), identified heat-induced proteins in related organisms (DnaK, GroEL, ClpP, RsbV, HSP16.4, YflT, PpiB, and TrxA), and other proteins (MreB, YloH, and YbbT). The upregulation of several stress proteins was confirmed by using antibodies specific for well-characterized heat shock proteins (HSPs) of B. subtilis. These observations indicate that heat adaptation of B. cereus involves proteins that function in a variety of cellular processes. Notably, a 30-min pre-exposure to 4\% ethanol, pH 5, or 2.5\% NaCl also results in increased thermotolerance. Also, for these adaptation processes, protein synthesis is required, and indeed, some HSPs are induced under these conditions. Collectively, these data show that during mild processing, cross-protection from heating occurs in pathogenic B. cereus, which may result in increased survival in foods.},

The strain was also found to be avirulent when tested in a mouse model of listerial infection. The concomitant loss of multiple characteristics such as production of LisA, Pic, Mpl, and loss of virulence in a mouse infection model is the result of a mutation in a single gene and demonstrates that the prfA gene product is a positive regulator of multiple virulence determinants in L. monocytogenes.},

Study of the E. coli and Yersinia enterocolitica Psp systems provides insights into how membrane-associated sensory Psp proteins might perceive membrane stress, signal to the transcription apparatus and use an ATP-hydrolysing transcription activator to produce effector proteins to overcome the stress. Progress in understanding the mechanism of signal transduction by the membrane-bound Psp proteins, regulation of the psp gene-specific transcription activator and the cell biology of the system is presented and discussed.

Mechanisms by which the Psp system detects the stress signal and responds have so far remained undetermined. Here we demonstrate that PspA and PspG directly confront a variety of inducing stimuli by switching the cell to anaerobic respiration and fermentation and by down-regulating motility, thereby subtly adjusting and maintaining energy usage and pmf. Additionally, PspG controls iron usage. We show that the Psp-inducing protein IV secretin stress, in the absence of Psp proteins, decreases the pmf in an ArcB-dependent manner and that ArcB is required for amplifying and transducing the stress signal to the PspF regulon. The requirement of the ArcB signal transduction protein for induction of \textit{psp} provides clear evidence for a direct link between the physiological redox state of the cell, the electron transport chain, and induction of the Psp response. Under normal growth conditions PspA and PspD control the level of activity of ArcB/ArcA system that senses the redox/metabolic state of the cell, whereas under stress conditions PspA, PspD, and PspG deliver their effector functions at least in part by activating ArcB/ArcA through positive feedback.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Sublethally heat-injured cells of Salmonella in food can recover under favorable conditions, leading to foodborne illness. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of recovery from heat injury, the global changes in gene transcription of Salmonella Typhimurium were investigated in previous study. In this study, the functions of genes involved in phage shock response (viz., phage shock protein (psp) genes), the transcription levels of which were found in previous study to be increased during recovery from heat injury, were investigated in recovering cells. The increase in pspABCDEFG transcription levels during the recovery process was confirmed by qRT-PCR. To understand the role of psp genes in heat injury recovery, a pspA deletion mutant (ΔpspA) and a pspA-overexpressing strain (S. Typhimurium pBAD30/pspA (+) ) were constructed. ΔpspA showed slightly lower viable counts and membrane potential than those of the wild-type strain during recovery. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the viable counts between S. Typhimurium pBAD30/pspA (+) and the control strains S. Typhimurium pBAD30/pspA (-) and S. Typhimurium pBAD30 (+) during recovery. It would seem that a lack of PspA protein alone somewhat affects the recovery of S. Typhimurium from heat injury, but overexpression of PspA alone is not sufficient to overcome this effect.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

Here, the single pot solid-phase enhanced sample preparation (SP3) protocol is adapted and combined with effective cell disruption using detergents for the proteome analysis of bacteria available in limited numbers only. Using this optimized protocol, identification of peptides and proteins for different Gram-positive and Gram-negative species can be dramatically increased and, reliable quantification can also be ensured. This adapted method is compared to already established strain-specific sample processing protocols for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, and Legionella pneumophila. The highest species-specific increase in identifications is observed using the adapted method with L. pneumophila samples by increasing protein and peptide identifications up to 300\% and 620\%, respectively. This increase is accompanied by an improvement in reproducibility of protein quantification and data completeness between replicates. Thus, this protocol is of interest for performing comprehensive proteomics analyses of low bacterial cell numbers from different settings ranging from infection assays to environmental samples.},

Understanding the mechanisms of virus transmission by these insect vectors is thus key for managing the spread of virus. This review describes current understandings of main fijiviruses and their insect vectors, transmission characteristics, effects of viruses on the behavior and physiology of vector insects, molecular transmission mechanisms. The relationships among transmission, virus epidemics and management are also discussed.

The major meatborne parasites include the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis spp., and the helminths Trichinella spp. and Taenia spp., all of which may be transmitted by pork. The significance of zoonotic parasites transmitted by pork consumption is emphasized by the prediction by the Food and Agriculture Organization of an 18.5\% increase in world pork production over the next 10 years. Of all the porkborne parasites, the three 'T' parasites have been responsible for most porkborne illness throughout history; they are still endemic, and therefore are important public-health concerns, in developing countries. Although the risk of porkborne parasites, particularly helminths, may currently be considered insignificant in developed countries, the modern trend of consuming raw meat favours their re-emergence. This paper overviews the main parasites transmitted to humans by pork, and outlines the main lines of prevention.},

	abstract = {The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.},

These pathogens which include both protozoa (e.g., Cryptosporidium spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis, Toxoplasma gondii) and helminths (e.g., liver and intestinal flukes, Fasciola spp., Paragonimus spp., Echinococcus spp., Taenia spp., Angiostrongylus spp., Anisakis spp., Ascaris spp., Capillaria spp., Toxocara spp., Trichinella spp., Trichostrongylus spp.), have accompanied the human species since its origin and their spread has often increased due to their behavior. Since both domesticated and wild animals play an important role as reservoirs of these pathogens the increase/decrease of their biomasses, migration, and passive introduction by humans can change their epidemiological patterns. It follows that globalization and climate change will have a tremendous impact on these pathogens modifying their epidemiological patterns and ecosystems due to the changes of biotic and abiotic parameters. The consequences of these changes on foodborne parasites cannot be foreseen as a whole due to their complexity, but it is important that biologists, epidemiologists, physicians and veterinarians evaluate/address the problem within a one health approach. This opinion, based on the author's experience of over 40 years in the parasitology field, takes into consideration the direct and indirect effects on the transmission of foodborne parasites to humans.},

	abstract = {Diarrhoea is a common, widespread and frustrating reality for sheep enterprises in most sheep producing regions globally and of particular concern in Australia as the major risk factor for breech flystrike. Parasitic disease has long been recognised as an important factor in diarrhoea in sheep, particularly the gastrointestinal nematodes (Trichostrongylus and Teladorsagia species). This review focuses on the role of parasitic infections in causing diarrhoea in sheep, with emphasis on the epidemiology of diarrhoea outbreaks related to worms and opportunities to manage the risk of diarrhoea outbreaks in sheep related to parasitic infections. Parasitic nematodes damage the gastrointestinal tract via a complex relationship between direct impacts from worms, such as physical changes to the gut mucosa, and indirect effects largely associated with the host response. Diarrhoea associated with large worm burdens is most efficiently managed through integrated parasite management programs. Despite some limitations, measuring faecal worm egg counts remains a mainstay for assessing the contribution of worms to outbreaks of diarrhoea in sheep. Larval hypersensitivity scouring is emerging as a significant cause of worm-related diarrhoea in sheep without large adult worm burdens in some geographic locations. The syndrome describes a heightened inflammatory response to the ingestion of trichostrongylid infective larvae seen in the gut of sheep with diarrhoea, and is most effectively addressed through selecting sheep for low breech soiling ('dag scores'), as worm resistant sheep may show an increased propensity for diarrhoea, even with low rates of larval challenge. Importantly, dag should be considered as a separate trait to WEC in breeding indexes. Outbreaks of diarrhoea in young sheep are often multifactorial, and co-infections with nematodes and other infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are common. This presents challenges for the field investigation of diarrhoea in grazing sheep.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic parasites are important causes of endemic and emerging human disease in northern North America and Greenland (the North), where prevalence of some parasites is higher than in the general North American population. The North today is in transition, facing increased resource extraction, globalisation of trade and travel, and rapid and accelerating environmental change. This comprehensive review addresses the diversity, distribution, ecology, epidemiology, and significance of nine zoonotic parasites in animal and human populations in the North. Based on a qualitative risk assessment with criteria heavily weighted for human health, these zoonotic parasites are ranked, in the order of decreasing importance, as follows: Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella and Giardia, Echinococcus granulosus/canadensis and Cryptosporidium, Toxocara, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes. Recent and future trends in the importance of these parasites for human health in the North are explored. For example, the incidence of human exposure to endemic helminth zoonoses (e.g. Diphyllobothrium, Trichinella, and Echinococcus) appears to be declining, while water-borne protozoans such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma may be emerging causes of human disease in a warming North. Parasites that undergo temperature-dependent development in the environment (such as Toxoplasma, ascarid and anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) will likely undergo accelerated development in endemic areas and temperate-adapted strains/species will move north, resulting in faunal shifts. Food-borne pathogens (e.g. Trichinella, Toxoplasma, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) may be increasingly important as animal products are exported from the North and tourists, workers, and domestic animals enter the North. Finally, key needs are identified to better assess and mitigate risks associated with zoonotic parasites, including enhanced surveillance in animals and people, detection methods, and delivery and evaluation of veterinary and public health services.},

Human taeniasis is an infectious disease caused by the ingestion of the metacestode larval stage, the cysticerci of T. saginata in beef or T. solium in pork. Humans can also become infected via the ingestion of T. solium eggs. In this case, the cysticerci can establish in the central nervous system, causing the infection called neurocysticercosis. T. solium is of higher importance than T. saginata because the former species can cause neurocysticercosis in humans, a major cause of neurological morbidity in the world. The taeniasis/cysticercosis complex is included in the list of neglected zoonotic diseases by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization, with T. solium being the number one foodborne parasite; it occurs mostly in developing countries, such as regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where the disease remains endemic. Long absent in Western Europe and other developed countries, cysticercosis has been recently re-emerged as a result of immigration, travel and commerce. In this review, cysticercosis is presented with special emphasis on some aspects of this neglected disease: the main clinical manifestations, risk factors and epidemiology. In addition, any recent advances in diagnostic approaches and treatment are discussed.

More than 50 species of Paragonimus have been reported throughout the world, of which seven valid species infect humans, an estimated one million people annually worldwide. Among the seven species, P. westermani, P. heterotremus, and P. skrjabini/P. s. miyazakii, distributed in Asia, are the most important species as the cause of paragonimiasis. Humans acquire infection through the ingestion of raw, pickled or undercooked freshwater crustaceans, 2nd intermediate hosts, or consuming raw meat of wild boar or deer, paratenic hosts. Infections often occur clustered in foci where dietary habits allow transmission of the parasites. Paragonimiasis typically causes a subacute to chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs. The symptoms, including chronic cough, chest pain, dyspnea and hemoptysis, mimic those of tuberculosis and lung cancer. Serologic tests are commonly used for the diagnosis of paragonimiasis, and Praziquantel is the treatment of choice.

The parasite life cycle stages, such as eggs, oocysts, and cysts, typically resist adverse temperatures, desiccation, natural irradiation, chemicals, and disinfectants that are commonly used for controlling bacteria and viruses. Other important parasites include trematodes such as Clonorchis and Paragonimus, which are transmitted via fish or crustaceans and cause serious human disease in specific regions of the world. The potential for global occurrence of these parasites is increasing. Control of zoonotic parasites at the producer level requires education and the development and implementation of effective measures to eliminate the contamination of agricultural water and feed with viable stages of parasites.

Globally, it is estimated that {\textgreater} 40 million people are infected among the 750 million people who live in endemic areas. The epidemiology of food-borne trematodiasis has changed over the past few decades, and now presents a dual picture. On the one hand, increasing numbers of infections are reported from non-endemic areas, and endemic areas are expanding due to larger areas utilised for aquaculture, domestic migration, declining socioeconomic conditions, lack of improved sanitation, and increasing availability of aquatic foods through wider distribution networks often without proper food inspections. On the other hand, social and economic advances in many Asian countries, going hand-in-hand with urbanisation, use of chemical fertilisers and, above all, the administration of safe, efficacious and inexpensive drugs, have significantly reduced the prevalence of food-borne trematode infections. In this review, the taxonomy, life cycle, and geographical distribution of the major food-borne trematodes, including issues of diagnosis and clinical disease manifestations, is summarised. The discovery, chemistry, pharmacological properties, safety, therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects of the current drugs of choice, namely praziquantel and triclabendazole, is then discussed. Recent advances on other drugs and contemporary investigations on novel compounds that might become important players in chemotherapy are highlighted. Finally, the need for research and development of new trematocidal drugs that - employed in concert with health education, improved sanitation and enhanced food safety - are key factors for sustainable control of food-borne trematodiasis, is highlighted.},

The complications are stone formation, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma.

	abstract = {Isospora belli, Cyclospora cayetanensis as well as several species of microsporidia are recognized as emerging protozoan pathogens of humans. All are obligate intracellular parasites, with Isospora and the microsporidia being primarily associated with immunocompromised hosts. Cyclospora is a cause of traveller's diarrhoea, and is responsible for water-borne and food-borne outbreaks of disease. Drug treatment is available for these infections. Improved diagnostic methods including the autofluorescence of I. belli and C. cayetanensis oocysts have assisted in the routine detection of these pathogens. Since the recognition of immunosuppression due to HIV infection, microsporidia have become recognized as important human pathogens with a continuing expansion of the parasite-associated clinico-pathological spectrum. The small size, intracellular nature and poor staining properties with many histological stains result in under-reporting of microsporidial infections. Trichrome stain and optical brighteners are used to detect spores in faeces, urines, respiratory secretions and other aspirates. Electron microscopy remains an important diagnostic method but its sensitivity is relatively poor. Molecular techniques should overcome current diagnostic limitations. The ability to extract DNA and amplify by PCR directly from clinical samples has increased the usefulness of molecular methods. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplicons can be used to determine genus, species and strain types of various microsporidia. Increased specificity is required in primer design because current primers used for amplifying non-microsporidian DNA also amplify microsporidian DNA. Diagnosis and pathogen characterisation rely increasingly on PCR-based approaches, and the sequence analysis approach becomes increasingly feasible and affordable. However, robust, reliable and sensitive methods are still required for dissecting pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmission routes and sources of infections.},

	volume = {167},
	issn = {0024-6921},
	abstract = {Gnathostomiasis is a foodborne zoonotic helminthic infection, commonly described in Asia and Latin America, which may follow the consumption of raw fish, eels, amphibians, and reptiles infected with muscle-encysted larvae of Gnathostoma species nematodes. After an inoculum of as little as one infective larva and an incubation period of months to years, most infections are characterized by intermittent migratory swellings due to subdermal larval migration. Less commonly, larval migration to the central nervous system may result in radiculomyelopathy or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with high fatality rates; or larval migration to the eye with resulting blindness in untreated cases. Since the US now supports a zoonosis of Gnathostoma species with infective larvae encysted in imported and domestic fish and eels that may be consumed raw as exotic ethnic dishes, the objectives of this review were to describe the biology and life cycle of Gnathostoma nematodes and the behavioral risk factors for gnathostomiasis; and to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prevention of human gnathostomiasis. Since the eradication of gnathostomiasis is very unlikely given the global distribution of Gnathostoma nematodes and the increasingly exotic culinary tastes of US residents and travelers to endemic regions, the only effective strategies for gnathostomiasis include: (1) educating citizens in the US and travelers abroad in endemic areas that fish, eels, frogs, snakes, and chicken must be cooked thoroughly first and not eaten raw or marinated; and (2) seeking medical care immediately for evaluation of migratory subcutaneous swellings. The combination of international travel and increased immigration from Asia and Latin America to the US has resulted in greater popularity of exotic ethnic cuisine, especially raw seafood dishes. The ethnic cuisine industry is supported by domestic aquaculture that produces fish-farmed tilapia and trout, and by increased importation of live freshwater species, such as Asian swamp eels (Monopterus spp.).1 Although raw seafood dishes are typically prepared with saltwater species, freshwater species, which harbor more parasites, are also used in these dishes, such as limejuice marinated tilapia or trout ceviche and eel-sashimi and sushi.2 In 2014, biologists from the US Geological Survey detected Gnathostoma species infective-stage larvae in nearly 30 percent of imported Monopterus species Asian swamp eels and in 4.5 percent of locally-caught Monopterus species freshwater swamp eels in three states.1 The investigators concluded that consumption of imported swamp eels from Gnathostoma-endemic regions of Asia could transmit gnathostomiasis to humans in the US.1 In addition, the release of live imported swamp eels or the disposal of their offal after filleting has introduced more Gnathostoma larvae into open and fish-farmed freshwaters infecting more native species.1 Since the US has all of the components to support Gnathostoma's life cycle, a zoonosis of infective Gnathostoma species, such as G. spinigerum and others, has become established in the US and will increase the risks of gnathostomiasis in humans consuming native, wildcaught, or farmed fish in ethnic dishes.1 As a result, the objectives of this review were to describe the biology and life cycle of Gnathostoma nematodes and the behavioral risk factors for gnathostomiasis; and to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prevention of human gnathostomiasis.},

Its etiological agents are the third-stage larvae of Gnathostoma spp. Human gnathostomiasis is often reported in developing countries, but it is also an emerging disease in developed countries in non-endemic areas. The recent surge in cases of human gnathostomiasis is mainly due to the increasing consumption of raw freshwater fish, amphibians, and reptiles.
METHODS: This article reviews the literature on Gnathostoma spp. and the disease that these parasites cause in humans. We review the literature on the life cycle and pathogenesis of these parasites, the clinical features, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, control, and new molecular findings on human gnathostomiasis, and social-ecological factors related to the transmission of this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The information presented provides an impetus for studying the parasite biology and host immunity. It is urgently needed to develop a quick and sensitive diagnosis and to develop an effective regimen for the management and control of human gnathostomiasis.},

	abstract = {Fascioliasis and other food-borne trematodiases are included in the list of important helminthiases with a great impact on human development. Six plant-borne trematode species have been found to affect humans: Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica and Fasciolopsis buski (Fasciolidae), Gastrodiscoides hominis (Gastrodiscidae), Watsonius watsoni and Fischoederius elongatus (Paramphistomidae). Whereas F. hepatica and F. gigantica are hepatic, the other four species are intestinal parasites. The fasciolids and the gastrodiscid cause important zoonoses distributed throughout many countries, while W. watsoni and F. elongatus have been only accidentally detected in humans. Present climate and global changes appear to increasingly affect snail-borne helminthiases, which are strongly dependent on environmental factors. Fascioliasis is a good example of an emerging/re-emerging parasitic disease in many countries as a consequence of many phenomena related to environmental changes as well as man-made modifications. The ability of F. hepatica to spread is related to its capacity to colonise and adapt to new hosts and environments, even at the extreme inhospitality of very high altitude. Moreover, the spread of F. hepatica from its original European range to other continents is related to the geographic expansion of its original European lymnaeid intermediate host species Galba truncatula, the American species Pseudosuccinea columella, and its adaptation to other lymnaeid species authochthonous in the newly colonised areas. Although fasciolopsiasis and gastrodiscoidiasis can be controlled along with other food-borne parasitoses, fasciolopsiasis still remains a public health problem in many endemic areas despite sustained WHO control programmes. Fasciolopsiasis has become a re-emerging infection in recent years and gastrodiscoidiasis, initially supposed to be restricted to Asian countries, is now being reported in African countries.},

	abstract = {This review examines the literature on imported (allochthonous) and local (autochthonous) cases of food-borne trematode (FBT) infections in the United States of America (USA) from 1890 to 2009. Most of the literature is concerned with imported cases of the opisthorchiids Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini. These flukes cause serious pathology in the liver and biliary system of humans. Chronic cases may induce liver (hepatocarcinoma) and bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) cancers in humans. Clonorchiasis and opithorchiasis are preventable diseases that can be avoided by eating properly cooked freshwater fish products. Several species of lung flukes in the genus Paragonimus are local or imported FBT in the USA. The endemic cycle occurs in the USA with various local snails and crustaceans serving as intermediate hosts. Paragonimids are acquired when humans eat raw or improperly cooked freshwater crustaceans containing metacercarial cysts. Infection can cause severe lung disease and the symptoms of paragonimiasis often mimic those of tuberculosis and other non-helminthic diseases. Paragonimiasis can be avoided by not eating raw or improperly cooked shellfish. The liver fluke Fasciola hepatica can be acquired by eating raw or uncooked vegetation. The cycle exists in the USA involving local snails and aquatic vegetation. Although some cases are local, most are imported by travelers or immigrants. Fascioliasis can cause serious liver and biliary diseases in humans and consumption of tainted vegetation should be avoided. Lesser known FBT have been reported in the USA including species of Alaria, echinostomids, heterophyids, troglotrematids, and a self-induced infection of Plagiorchis. Treatment of the FBT mentioned in this review consists of various regimens of praziquantel, except for F. hepatica where the drug of choice is triclabendazole.},

	abstract = {Fascioliasis is a foodborne zoonotic disease caused by the two parasite species Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. This trematodiasis has never been claimed special relevance for travellers and migrants. However, the situation has drastically changed in the last two decades, in a way that fascioliasis should today be included in the list of diseases to be enhanced in Travel Medicine. Different kind of travellers have been involved in human infection reports: business travellers, tourists, migrants, expatriated workers, military personnel, religious missionaries, and refugees. Europe is the continent where more imported cases have been reported in many countries. More cases would have been probably reported in Europe if fascioliasis would be a reportable disease. In the Americas, most of the reports concern cases diagnosed in USA. Relative few patients have been diagnosed in studies on travellers performed in Asia. In Africa, most cases were reported in Maghreb countries. Blood eosinophilia and the ingestion of watercress or any other suggestive freshwater plant in anamnesis are extremely useful in guiding towards a fascioliasis diagnosis in a developed country, although may not be so in human endemic areas of developing countries. Several suggestive clinical presentation aspects may be useful, although the clinical polymorphism may be misleading in many cases. Non-invasive techniques are helpful for the diagnosis, although images may lead to confusion. Laparoscopic visualization should assist and facilitate procurement of an accurately guided biopsy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the first choice in patients in the chronic phase. ERCP and sphincterotomy are used to extract parasites from the biliary tree. Fluke egg finding continues to be the gold standard and enables for burden quantification and establishing of the drug dose. Many serological and stool antigen detection tests have been developed. Immunological techniques present the advantages of being applicable during all periods of the disease, but fundamentally during the invasive or acute period, as well as to other situations in which coprological techniques may present problems. Triclabendazole is the drug of choice at present, although the spread of resistance to this drug is challenging. Prevention mainly concerns measures to avoid individual infection by considering the different human infection sources.},

Two separate life cycles of echinostomes, human and sylvatic, efficiently operate in endemic areas. Clinical symptoms of echinostomiasis include abdominal pain, violent watery diarrhea, and anorexia. The disease occurs focally and transmission is linked to fresh or brackish water habitats. Infections are associated with common sociocultural practices of eating raw or insufficiently cooked mollusks, fish, crustaceans, and amphibians, promiscuous defecation, and the use of night soil (human excrement collected from latrines) for fertilization of fish ponds. The prevalence of infection ranges from 44\% in the Philippines to 5\% in mainland China, and from 50\% in northern Thailand to 9\% in Korea. Although the patterns of other food-borne trematodiases have changed in Asia following changes in habits, cultural practices, health education, industrialization, and environmental alteration, human echinostomiasis remains a health problem. The disease is most prevalent in remote rural places among low-wage earners and in women of child bearing age. Echinostomiasis is aggravated by socioeconomic factors such as poverty, malnutrition, an explosively growing free-food market, a lack of supervised food inspection, poor or insufficient sanitation, other helminthiases, and declining economic conditions. Furthermore, World Health Organization control programs implemented for other food-borne helminthiases and sustained in endemic areas are not fully successful for echinostomiasis because these parasites display extremely broad specificity for the second intermediate host and are capable of completing the life cycle without involvement of the human host.},

Human infections are acquired by ingesting the raw or undercooked meat of snakes or frogs, drinking untreated water, or using raw flesh in traditional poultices. More than 1600 cases of sparganosis have been documented worldwide, mostly in east and southeast Asia. Sporadic cases have been reported in South America, Europe, and Africa, and several cases have been described in travellers returning from endemic regions. Epidemiological data suggest that the increased effect of sparganosis on human health is because of greater consumption of raw meat of freshwater frogs and snakes. This Review provides information about the Spirometra parasites and their lifecycles, summarises clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of human sparganosis, and describes geographical distribution and infection characteristics of Spirometra parasites in host animals.},

With the increase in international travel to remote areas of the world, globalization of the food supply, and changes in food habits, more people are consuming dishes once considered exotic. Such behavioral changes require awareness by consumers and clinicians about the risks of food-borne infections. This chapter addresses pathogens associated with consumption of raw or undercooked seafood including anisakidosis, Diphyllobothrium latum infection, flukes, and other infectious and toxin-mediated diseases. We discuss the geographic distribution of the pathogens, symptomatology, and basic principles of treatment. Food products derived from turtles, snakes, and other reptiles are reviewed, and we address the risk of gnathostomiasis, sparganosis, trichinellosis, and other pathogens. In discussing infections associated with undercooked beef, pork, and bush meat, we address dysentery, amebiasis, toxoplasmosis, Taenia infections, and risks of novel viral infections, among others. We also review infectious risks from poultry, dairy, and other food items, focusing on those organisms encountered less frequently by clinicians in developed countries. The wide range of infectious organisms related to exotic cuisine underscores the importance of educating the adventurous traveler and warrants continued vigilance on the part of the clinician.},

Deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all B. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive target organisms. PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the B. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. The remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. Further analyses identified a peptide of {\textasciitilde}1,422 Da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. N-terminal sequencing of the {\textasciitilde}1,422 Da peptide from one strain identified it as ILPEITXIFHD. This peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by Bacillus spp. Subsequent PCR analyses demonstrated that the six B. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that the {\textasciitilde}1,422 Da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.},

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a critical factor involved in many biochemical reactions, especially antibiotic production. However, whether SAM affects bacitracin synthesis is still unknown. Here, we want to analyze the relationship between SAM supply and bacitracin synthesis, and then metabolic engineering of SAM synthetic pathway for bacitracin production in Bacillus licheniformis. Firstly, our results implied that SAM exogenous addition benefited bacitracin production, which yield was increased by 12.13\% under the condition of 40 mg/L SAM addition. Then, SAM synthetases and Methionine (Met) synthetases from B. licheniformis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were screened and overexpressed to improve SAM accumulation, and the combination of SAM synthetase from S. cerevisiae and Met synthetase from B. licheniformis showed the best performance, and 70.12\% increase of intracellular SAM concentration (31.54 mg/L) and 13.08\% increase of bacitraicn yield (839.54 U/mL) were achieved in resultant strain DW2-KE. Furthermore, Met transporters MetN and MetP were, respectively, identified as Met exporter and importer, and bacitracin yield was further increased by 5.94\% to 889.42 U/mL via deleting metN and overexpressing metP in DW2-KE, attaining strain DW2-KENP. Finally, SAM nucleosidase gene mtnN and SAM decarboxylase gene speD were deleted to block SAM degradation pathways, and bacitracin yield of resultant strain DW2-KENPND reached 957.53 U/mL, increased by 28.97\% compared to DW2. Collectively, this study demonstrated that SAM supply served as the critical role in bacitracin synthesis, and a promising strain B. licheniformis DW2-KENPND was attained for industrial production of bacitracin.},

From the approximately 200 spots visible on the gels, 89 were identified that either contain an N-terminal signal sequence or are known to be secreted by other mechanisms than the Sec pathway. The extracellular proteome of B. licheniformis includes proteins from different functional classes, like enzymes for the degradation of various macromolecules, proteins involved in cell wall turnover, flagellum- and phage-related proteins and some proteins of yet unknown function. Protein secretion is highest during stationary growth phase. Furthermore, cells grown in complex medium secrete considerably higher protein amounts than cells grown in minimal medium.

The important chemical sporicides are glutaraldehyde, chorine-releasing agents, peroxygens, and ethylene oxide. Some food-grade antimicrobial agents exhibit sporostatic and sporicidal activities, such as protamine, polylysine, sodium lactate, essential oils. Surfactants with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties have been reported to have inactivation activity against spores. The combined treatment of physical and chemical treatment such as heating, UHP (ultra high pressure), PEF (pulsed electric field), UV (ultraviolet), IPL (intense pulsed light) and natural antimicrobial agents can act synergistically and effectively to kill Bacillus spores in the food industry.},

	abstract = {Composting involves the selection of a microbiota capable of resisting the high temperatures generated during the process and degrading the lignocellulose. A deep understanding of the thermophilic microbial community involved in such biotransformation is valuable to improve composting efficiency and to provide thermostable biomass-degrading enzymes for biorefinery. This study investigated the lignocellulose-degrading thermophilic microbial culturome at all the stages of plant waste composting, focusing on the dynamics, enzymes, and thermotolerance of each member of such a community. The results revealed that 58\% of holocellulose (cellulose plus hemicellulose) and 7\% of lignin were degraded at the end of composting. The whole fungal thermophilic population exhibited lignocellulose-degrading activity, whereas roughly 8-10\% of thermophilic bacteria had this trait, although exclusively for hemicellulose degradation (xylan-degrading). Because of the prevalence of both groups, their enzymatic activity, and the wide spectrum of thermotolerance, they play a key role in the breakdown of hemicellulose during the entire process, whereas the degradation of cellulose and lignin is restricted to the activity of a few thermophilic fungi that persists at the end of the process. The xylanolytic bacterial isolates (159 strains) included mostly members of Firmicutes (96\%) as well as a few representatives of Actinobacteria (2\%) and Proteobacteria (2\%). The most prevalent species were Bacillus licheniformis and Aeribacillus pallidus. Thermophilic fungi (27 strains) comprised only four species, namely Thermomyces lanuginosus, Talaromyces thermophilus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Gibellulopsis nigrescens, of whom A. fumigatus and T. lanuginosus dominated. Several strains of the same species evolved distinctly at the stages of composting showing phenotypes with different thermotolerance and new enzyme expression, even not previously described for the species, as a response to the changing composting environment. Strains of Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, T. lanuginosus, and A. fumigatus exhibiting considerable enzyme activities were selected as potential candidates for the production of thermozymes. This study lays a foundation to further investigate the mechanisms of adaptation and acquisition of new traits among thermophilic lignocellulolytic microorganisms during composting as well as their potential utility in biotechnological processing.},

	abstract = {Bacillus licheniformis can cause foodborne intoxication due to the production of the surfactant lichenysin. The aim of this study was to measure the production of lichenysin by food isolates of B. licheniformis in LB medium and skimmed milk and its cytotoxicity for intestinal cells. Out of 11 B. licheniformis isolates tested, most showed robust growth in high salt (1M NaCl), 4\% ethanol, at 37 or 55°C, and aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All strains produced lichenysin (in varying amounts), but not all strains were hemolytic. Production of this stable compound by selected strains (high producers B4094 and B4123, and type strain DSM13T) was subsequently determined using LB medium and milk, at 37 and 55°C. Lichenysin production in LB broth and milk was not detected at cell densities {\textless} 5 log10 CFU/ml. The highest concentrations were found in the stationary phase of growth. Total production of lichenysin was 4–20 times lower in milk than in LB broth (maximum 36 μg/ml), and ∼10 times lower in the biomass obtained from milk agar than LB agar. Under all conditions tested, strain B4094 consistently yielded the highest amounts. Besides strain variation and medium composition, temperature also had an effect on lichenysin production, with twofold lower amounts of lichenysin produced at 55°C than at 37°C. All three strains produced lichenysin A with varying acyl chain lengths (C11–C18). The relative abundance of the C14 variant was highest in milk and the C15 variant highest in LB. The concentration of lichenysin needed to reduce cell viability by 50\% (IC50) was 16.6 μg/ml for Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells and 16.8 μg/ml for pig ileum organoids. Taken together, the presence of low levels ({\textless}5 log10 CFU/ml) of B. licheniformis in foods is unlikely to pose a foodborne hazard related to lichenysin production. However, depending on the strain present, the composition, and storage condition of the food, a risk of foodborne intoxication may arise if growth to high levels is supported and such product is ingested.},

The photochemistry of YtvA and of its isolated LOV domain (YtvA-LOV) has been characterized by optical, mass spectrometric and photocalorimetric methods. The energy content (E390) of the FMN-C4a-thiol photoadduct (YtvA390 and YtvA-LOV390) and its structural volume change (ΔV390), with respect to the parent state, have been determined by means of Laser Induced Optoacoustic Spectroscopy (LIOAS). The high value of E390, 136 and 115 kJ mol−1, respectively, ensures a large driving force for the dark recovery to the unphotolyzed state and points to a strained conformation of the protein or/and the chromophore in the photoadduct. The value of ΔV390 is significantly different for the two proteins, ΔV390 = −12.5 ml mol−1 in YtvA and −17.2 ml mol−1 in YtvA-LOV. The kinetics of the dark recovery reaction for YtvA-LOV is slower than for full-length YtvA, with τrec = 3900 and 2600 s at 25 °C, respectively, and shows a different temperature dependence. A similarly slow kinetics can be induced in YtvA by high ionic strength. Minor differences are observed in the fluorescence and photoadduct formation quantum yield. The overall stability is higher for YtvA than for YtvA-LOV. The data as a whole are indicative of an interaction between the two domains of YtvA, most probably mediated by electrostatic interactions that renders the full-length protein a compact and more rigid unit. The results reported here support the idea that the formation of the photoadduct changes the dynamics of the protein, depending on the conformational flexibility of the parent state. Flashing of the photoadduct induces a negligible ΔV, with 96\% of the excitation energy dissipated as heat in {\textless}20 ns, indicating that the photoadduct does not undergo a photocycle on the LIOAS time scale, or that the photoinduced reactions occur with very low yield.},

The RsbT serine-threonine kinase is required to convey environmental stress signals to sigma(B), and this kinase activity is magnified in vitro by the RsbR protein, a positive regulator important for full in vivo response to salt or heat stress. Previous genetic analysis suggested that RsbR function is redundant with other unidentified regulators. A search of the translated B. subtilis genome found six paralogous proteins with significant similarity to RsbR: YetI, YezB, YkoB, YojH, YqhA, and YtvA. Their possible regulatory roles were investigated using three different approaches. First, genetic analysis found that null mutations in four of the six paralogous genes have marked effects on the sigma(B) environmental signaling pathway, either singly or in combination. The two exceptions were yetI and yezB, adjacent genes which appear to encode a split paralog. Second, biochemical analysis found that YkoB, YojH, and YqhA are specifically phosphorylated in vitro by the RsbT environmental signaling kinase, as had been previously shown for RsbR, which is phosphorylated on two threonine residues in its C-terminal region. Both residues are conserved in the three phosphorylated paralogs but are absent in the ones that were not substrates of RsbT: YetI and YezB, each of which bears only one of the conserved residues; and YtvA, which lacks both residues and instead possesses an N-terminal PAS domain. Third, analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system suggested that all six paralogs interact with each other and with the RsbR and RsbS environmental regulators. Our data indicate that (i) RsbR, YkoB, YojH, YqhA, and YtvA function in the environmental stress signaling pathway; (ii) YtvA acts as a positive regulator; and (iii) RsbR, YkoB, YojH, and YqhA collectively act as potent negative regulators whose loss increases sigma(B) activity more than 400-fold in unstressed cells.},

	abstract = {SigmaB, an alternative sigma-factor of Bacillus subtilis, mediates the response of the cell to a variety of physical insults. Within the environmental stress signalling pathway RsbU, a protein phosphatase, is stimulated by its interaction with the protein kinase RsbT. In the absence of stress RsbT is expected to be trapped by an alternative binding partner, RsbS. Here, we have demonstrated that RsbS alone cannot act as an alternative partner for RsbT, but instead requires the presence of RsbR to create a high molecular mass RsbR:RsbS complex (approximately 1 MDa) able to capture RsbT. In this complex the phosphorylation state of RsbS, and not that of RsbR, controlled the binding to RsbT, whose kinase activity towards RsbS could be counterbalanced by the activity of RsbX, the phosphatase for RsbS-P. The RsbR:RsbS complex recruited RsbT from a mixture of RsbT and RsbU. The phosphorylated form of RsbR in the complex enhanced the kinase activity of RsbT towards RsbS. This supramolecular complex thus has the functional properties of an alternative partner for RsbT. Electron micrographs of this complex are presented, and the purification of the RsbR:RsbS complex from cellular extracts provides evidence for the existence of such a complex in vivo.},

STAS domains of divergent amino acid sequence exhibit a conserved fold of 4 β strands interspersed among 5 α helices. The first STAS domain proteins studied were single-domain anti-sigma factor antagonists (anti-anti-σ). These anti-anti-σ indirectly stimulate bacterial RNA polymerase by inactivating inhibitory anti-σ kinases, liberating σ factors to direct specific transcription of target genes or operons. Some STAS domains are nucleotide-binding phosphoproteins or nucleotidases. Others are interaction/transduction modules within multidomain sensors of light, oxygen and other gasotransmitters, cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, and G proteins. Additional multidomain STAS protein sequences suggest functions in sensing, metabolism, or transport of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, anions, vitamins, or hydrocarbons. Still other multidomain STAS polypeptides include histidine and serine/threonine kinase domains and ligand-activated transcription factor domains. SulP/SLC26 STAS domains and adjacent sequences interact with other transporters, cytoskeletal scaffolds, and with enzymes metabolizing transported anion substrates, forming putative metabolons. STAS domains are central to membrane targeting of many SulP/SLC26 anion transporters, and STAS domain mutations are associated with at least three human recessive diseases.

	abstract = {One of the strongest and most noticeable responses of a Bacillus subtilis cell to a range of stress and starvation conditions is the dramatic induction of a large number of general stress proteins. The alternative sigma factor σB is responsible for the induction of the genes encoding these general stress proteins that occurs following heat, ethanol, salt or acid stress, or during energy depletion. σB was detected more than 20 years ago by Richard Losick and William Haldenwang as the first alternative sigma factor of bacteria, but interest in σB declined after it was realized that σB is not involved in sporulation. It later turned out that σB,whose activity itself is tightly controlled, is absolutely required for the induction of this regulon, not only in B. subtilis, but also in other Gram-positive bacteria. These findings may have been responsible for the recent revival of interest in σB. This chapter summarizes the current information on this σB response including the latest results on the signal transduction pathways, the structure of the regulon and its physiological role. More than 150 general stress proteins/genes belong to this σB regulon, which is believed to provide the non-growing cell with a nonspecific, multiple and preventive stress resistance. σB-dependent stress proteins are involved in non-specific protection against oxidative stress and also protect cells against heat, acid, alkaline or osmotic stress. A cell in the transition from a growing to a non-growing state induced by energy depletion will be equipped with a comprehensive stress resistance machine to protect it against future stress. The protection against oxidative stress may be an essential part of this response. In addition, preloading of cells with σB-dependent stress proteins, induced by mild heat or salt stress, will protect cells against a severe, potentially lethal, future stress. Both the specific protection against an acute emerging stress, as well as the non-specific, prospective protection against future stress, are adaptive functions crucial for surviving stress and starvation in nature. We suggest that the σB response is one essential component of survival strategy that ensures survival in a quiescent, vegetative state as an alternative to sporulation. The role of σB in related Gram-positive bacteria (including cyanobacteria) with special emphasis on pathogenic bacteria is discussed.},

In this investigation the N-terminal sequences of 13 stress proteins of B. subtilis were determined. The quantification of the mRNA and the analysis of the protein synthesis pattern support the initial hypothesis that the chaperones DnaK and GroEL are Hsps in B. subtilis. In contrast, the recently described proteins GsiB, Ctc and RsbW belong to a class of Gsps that are induced by various stresses including heat shock. The main part of the Gsps described in this study failed to be induced in the sigB deletion mutant ML6 in response to heat shock. However, all the five Hsps were induced in this mutant in response to heat shock. These data indicate that SigB plays a crucial role in the induction of general stress genes, but is dispensable for the induction of Hsps.},

Western blot (immunoblot) analyses, in which monoclonal antibodies specific for the sigB operon products RsbV, RsbW, and sigma B were used to probe extracts from wild-type and mutant B. subtilis strains, revealed that all three proteins increased coordinately after heat shock and that this increase was dependent on sigma B but not RsbV, a positive regulator normally essential for sigma B-dependent sigB expression. Nuclease protection experiments of RNA synthesized after heat shock supported the notion that the shift to 48 degrees C enhanced transcription from the sigB operon's sigma B-dependent promoter. The level of mRNA initiating at the sigma B-dependent ctc promoter was also seen to increase approximately 5- to 10-fold after heat shock. Pulse-labeling of the proteins synthesized after a shift to 48 degrees C demonstrated that sigB wild-type and mutant strains produced the major heat-inducible proteins in similar amounts; however, at least seven additional proteins were present after the temperature shift in the wild-type strain but absent in the sigB null mutant. Thus, although sigma B is not required for the expression of essential heat shock genes, it is activated by heat shock to elevate its own synthesis and possibly the synthesis of several other heat-inducible proteins.},

	abstract = {Bacillus subtilis cells respond almost immediately to different stress conditions by increasing the production of general stress proteins (GSPs). The genes encoding the majority of the GSPs that are induced by heat, ethanol, salt stress or by starvation for glucose, oxygen or phosphate belong to the sigmaB-dependent general stress regulon. Despite a good understanding of the complex regulation of the activity of sigmaB and knowledge of a very large number of general stress genes controlled by sigmaB, first insights into the physiological role of this nonspecific stress response have been obtained only very recently. To explore the physiological role of this reguIon, we and others identified sigmaB-dependent general stress genes and compared the stress tolerance of wild-type cells with mutants lacking sigmaB or general stress proteins. The proteins encoded by sigmaB-dependent general stress genes can be divided into at least five functional groups that most probably provide growth-restricted B. subtilis cells with a multiple stress resistance in anticipation of future stress. In particular, sigB mutants are impaired in non-specific resistance to oxidative stress, which requires the sigmaB-dependent dps gene encoding a DNA-protecting protein. Protection against oxidative damage of membranes, proteins or DNA could be the most essential component of sigmaB mediated general stress resistance in growth-arrested aerobic gram-positive bacteria. Other general stress genes have both a sigmaB-dependent induction pathway and a second sigmaB-independent mechanism of stress induction, thereby partially compensating for a sigmaB deficiency in a sigB mutant. In contrast to sigB mutants, null mutations in genes encoding those proteins, such as cIpP or cIpC, cause extreme sensitivity to salt or heat.},

One critical mechanism to rapidly detect and adapt to changes in environmental conditions is control of gene expression at the level of protein synthesis. At each of the three major steps of translation—initiation, elongation, and termination—cells use stimuli to tune translation rate and cellular protein concentrations. For example, changes in nutrient concentrations in the cell can lead to translational responses involving mechanisms such as dynamic folding of riboswitches during translation initiation or the synthesis of alarmones, which drastically alter cell physiology. Moreover, the cell can fine-tune the levels of specific protein products using programmed ribosome pausing or inducing frameshifting. Recent studies have improved understanding and revealed greater complexity regarding long-standing paradigms describing key regulatory steps of translation such as start-site selection and the coupling of transcription and translation. In this review, we describe how bacteria regulate their gene expression at the three translational steps and discuss how translation is used to detect and respond to changes in the cellular environment. Finally, we appraise the costs and benefits of regulation at the translational level in bacteria.},

A recurring theme in sigma factor control is their sequestration by anti-sigma factors that occlude their RNAP-binding determinants. Sigma factors are then released through a wide variety of mechanisms, often involving branched signal transduction pathways that allow the integration of distinct signals. Three major strategies for sigma release are discussed: regulated proteolysis, partner-switching, and direct sensing by the anti-sigma factor.},

Our results identify {\textgreater}80 genes as at least partially dependent on ECF σ factors, and as expected, most of these are dependent on σM, σW, or σX, which are active at a significant basal level during growth. Several genes, including the eps operon encoding enzymes for exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, were decreased in expression in the Δ7ECF mutant but affected less in the ΔMWX mutant. Consistent with this observation, the Δ7ECF mutant (but not the ΔMWX mutant) showed reduced biofilm formation. Extending previous observations, we also note that the ΔMWX mutant is sensitive to a variety of antibiotics and the Δ7ECF mutant is either as sensitive as, or slightly more sensitive than, the ΔMWX strain to these stressors. These findings emphasize the overlapping nature of the seven ECF σ factor regulons in B. subtilis, confirm that three of these (σM, σW, and σX) play the dominant role in conferring intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, and provide initial insights into the roles of the remaining ECF σ factors.},

This 135 kb viral genome is integrated into the circular DNA chromosome of B. subtilis, and contains genes for the production of and resistance to sublancin. We investigated the role of SigY in sublancin production and resistance, finding that it is important for efficient maintenance of the Spβ prophage. We were unable to detect the prophage in mutants lacking SigY. Additionally, these mutants were no longer able to produce sublancin, were sensitive to killing by this factor, and displayed a delay in sporulation. Wild-type cells with normal SigY activity were found to partially lose the Spβ prophage during growth and early sporulation, suggesting a mechanism for the bistable outcome of sibling cells capable of killing and of being killed. The appropriate regulation of SigY appears to be essential for growth as evidenced by the inability to disrupt the gene for its putative antisigma. Our results confirm a role for SigY in antibiotic production and resistance, as has been found for other members of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family in B. subtilis, and shows that this role is achieved by affecting maintenance of the Spβ prophage.},

Laspartomycin C is a novel antibiotic that targets undecaprenyl phosphate (UP), a key intermediate in the lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis. While laspartomycin C has been thoroughly examined biochemically, detailed knowledge about potential resistance mechanisms in bacteria is lacking. Here, we use reporter strains to monitor the activity of central resistance modules in the Bacillus subtilis cell envelope stress response network during laspartomycin C attack and determine the impact on the resistance of these modules using knock-out strains. In contrast to the closely related UP-binding antibiotic friulimicin B, which only activates ECF σ factor-controlled stress response modules, we find that laspartomycin C additionally triggers activation of stress response systems reacting to membrane perturbation and blockage of other lipid II cycle intermediates. Interestingly, none of the studied resistance genes conferred any kind of protection against laspartomycin C. While this appears promising for therapeutic use of laspartomycin C, it raises concerns that existing cell envelope stress response networks may already be poised for spontaneous development of resistance during prolonged or repeated exposure to this new antibiotic.},

The Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis provides a valuable model for investigation of the ECF sigma factors. This review focuses on the function and regulation of ECF sigma factors in B. subtilis, in which anti-sigma factors play a role in connecting an external stimulus with gene regulation. As representative examples, the regulon and regulatory mechanism of σW are closely associated with membrane-active stressors, whereas σM is strongly induced by conditions that impair peptidoglycan synthesis. These studies demonstrate that the mechanisms of ECF-dependent signaling are divergent and constitute a multi-layered hierarchy, and provide useful insights into the elucidation of unknown mechanisms related to ECF sigma factors.},

	abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor sigma(W) controls a large regulon that is strongly induced by alkali shock. To define the physiological role of sigma(W) we have sought to identify the complete set of genes under sigma(W) control. Previously, we described a promoter consensus search procedure to identify sigma(W) controlled genes. Herein, we introduce a novel method to identify additional target promoters: run-off transcription followed by macroarray analysis (ROMA). We compare the resulting list of targets with those identified in conventional transcriptional profiling studies and using the consensus search approach. While transcriptional profiling identifies genes that are strongly dependent on sigma(W) for in vivo expression, some sigma(W)-dependent promoters are not detected due to the masking effects of other promoter elements, overlapping recognition with other ECF sigma factors, or both. Taken together, the consensus search, ROMA, and transcriptional profiling approaches establish a minimum of 30 promoter sites (controlling approximately 60 genes) as direct targets for activation by sigma(W). Significantly, no single approach identifies more than approximately 80\% of the regulon so defined. We therefore suggest that a combination of two or more complementary approaches be employed in studies seeking to achieve maximal coverage when defining bacterial regulons. Our results indicate that sigma(W) controls genes that protect the cell against agents that impair cell wall biosynthesis but fail to reveal any connection to operons likely to function in adaptation to alkaline growth conditions. This is consistent with the observation that a sigW mutant is unaffected in its ability to survive alkali shock. We conclude that in B. subtilis sudden imposition of alkali stress activates the sigma(W) stress response, perhaps by impairing the ability of the cell wall biosynthetic machinery to function.},

Here, we demonstrate that σ(M)  is responsible for intrinsic β-lactam resistance, with σ(X)  playing a secondary role. Activation of σ(M)  upregulates several cell wall biosynthetic enzymes including one, PBP1, shown here to be a target for the beta-lactam cefuroxime. However, σ(M)  still plays a major role in cefuroxime resistance even in cells lacking PBP1. To better define the role of σ(M)  in β-lactam resistance, we characterized suppressor mutations that restore cefuroxime resistance to a sigM null mutant. The most frequent suppressors inactivated gdpP (yybT) which encodes a cyclic-di-AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). Intriguingly, σ(M)  is a known activator of disA encoding one of three paralogous diadenylate cyclases (DAC). Overproduction of the GdpP PDE greatly sensitized cells to β-lactam antibiotics. Conversely, genetic studies indicate that at least one DAC is required for growth with depletion leading to cell lysis. These findings support a model in which c-di-AMP is an essential signal molecule required for cell wall homeostasis. Other suppressors highlight the roles of ECF σ factors in counteracting the deleterious effects of autolysins and reactive oxygen species in β-lactam-treated cells.},

This result suggests that forespore genes are transcribed by E sigma F in spoIIIE and spoIIIE spoIIIG mutants. Comparison of the promoter regions of genes transcribed well and poorly by E sigma F in vivo and in vitro showed that good transcription by E sigma F was correlated with G residues at positions -15 and -16, a purine residue at position -13, and a T residue at position -7 relative to the start site of transcription.

	abstract = {The mother-cell line of gene expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is a hierarchical cascade consisting of at least four temporally controlled gene sets, the first three of which each contain a regulatory gene for the next gene set in the pathway. gerE, a member of the penultimate gene set, is a regulatory gene whose products is required for the transcriptional activation of genes (coat protein genes cotB and cotC) in the last gene set. The gerE product also influences the expression of other members of the penultimate gene set (coat protein genes cotA and cotD appear to be repressed and activated, respectively). We now report that the purified product of gerE (GerE) is a DNA-binding protein that adheres to the promoters for cotB and cotC. We also show that GerE stimulates cotB and cotC transcription in vitro by RNA polymerase containing the mother-cell sigma factor sigma K. These findings support the view that GerE is a positively acting, regulatory protein whose appearance at a late stage of development directly activates the transcription of genes in the last known temporal class of mother-cell-expressed genes. In addition, GerE stimulates cotD transcription and inhibits cotA transcription in vitro by sigma K RNA polymerase, as expected from in vivo studies, and, unexpectedly, profoundly inhibits in vitro transcription of the gene (sigK) that encodes sigma K. The effects of GerE on cotD and sigK transcription are just the opposite of the effects exerted by the earlier-appearing, mother-cell regulatory protein spoIIID, suggesting that the ordered appearance of first SpoIIID, then GerE, ensures proper flow of the regulatory cascade controlling gene expression in the mother cell.},

Recent work has suggested that these genes are transcribed by a minor form of RNA polymerase, E sigma H (sigma H is the product of spo0H, another early sporulation gene). We directly tested this hypothesis by performing in vitro transcription assays with reconstituted E sigma H and a set of plasmids containing the kinA, spo0F, and spo0A promoter regions. We were able to obtain distinct transcripts of the expected sizes with all three genes by using linearized or supercoiled templates. Furthermore, primer extension experiments indicate that the transcription start sites for the three genes in vitro and in vivo are the same. In addition, we measured steady-state levels of kinA, spo0F, and spo0A mRNAs during growth in sporulation medium; all of them were increased at or near the beginning of the stationary phase.},

Genes for flagellar and chemotaxis proteins are expressed in a complex transcriptional cascade. This regulatory hierarchy acts to ensure that the highly expressed filament structural protein, flagellin, is synthesized only after a prerequisite set of structural proteins has been expressed and properly assembled. Recent evidence suggests that many bacteria utilize an alternative sigma (sigma) subunit, similar in specificity to the Bacillus subtilis sigma 28 protein, to direct transcription of flagellin, chemotaxis and motility genes. In Caulobacter crescentus and Campylobacter spp., both a sigma 54-like factor and a sigma 28-like factor participate in the transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes. Conversely, a sigma 28-like factor controls non-motility functions in at least one non-flagellated organism.},

Conformity to the preferred --35 and --10 sequences may not be sufficient to promote efficient utilization by B. subtilis RNA polymerase, however, since three promoters (veg, tms and E. coli tac) that conform to these sequences and that are utilized efficiently by E. coli RNA polymerase were used with highly varied efficiencies by B. subtilis RNA polymerase.

	abstract = {The specificity of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase for target promotes is largely due to the replaceable sigma subunit that it carries. Multiple sigma proteins, each conferring a unique promoter preference on RNA polymerase, are likely to be present in all bacteria; however, their abundance and diversity have been best characterized in Bacillus subtilis, the bacterium in which multiple sigma factors were first discovered. The 10 sigma factors thus far identified in B. subtilis directly contribute to the bacterium's ability to control gene expression. These proteins are not merely necessary for the expression of those operons whose promoters they recognize; in many instances, their appearance within the cell is sufficient to activate these operons. This review describes the discovery of each of the known B. subtilis sigma factors, their characteristics, the regulons they direct, and the complex restrictions placed on their synthesis and activities. These controls include the anticipated transcriptional regulation that modulates the expression of the sigma factor structural genes but, in the case of several of the B. subtilis sigma factors, go beyond this, adding novel posttranslational restraints on sigma factor activity. Two of the sigma factors (sigma E and sigma K) are, for example, synthesized as inactive precursor proteins. Their activities are kept in check by "pro-protein" sequences which are cleaved from the precursor molecules in response to intercellular cues. Other sigma factors (sigma B, sigma F, and sigma G) are inhibited by "anti-sigma factor" proteins that sequester them into complexes which block their ability to form RNA polymerase holoenzymes. The anti-sigma factors are, in turn, opposed by additional proteins which participate in the sigma factors' release. The devices used to control sigma factor activity in B, subtilis may prove to be as widespread as multiple sigma factors themselves, providing ways of coupling sigma factor activation to environmental or physiological signals that cannot be readily joined to other regulatory mechanisms.},

The objective of the present study was the unequivocal identification of its anti-sigma factor and of genes controlled by σV. In many cases reported so far the gene coding for the anti-sigma factor is located immediately downstream of the gene coding for the sigma factor, and both form a bicistronic operon. We could show by two different experimental approaches that this is also the case for sigV and rsiV. Under conditions of overproduction of σV, 13 genes could be identified being induced several-fold by the DNA macroarray technique. Induction of three of them was confirmed by Northern blots, and the potential promoter of sigV was identified by primer extension. This led to the deduction of a consensus sequence recognized by σV.},

	abstract = {Bacteria from the Bacillus group are microorganisms that inhabit a large number of different habitats. They are well known as producers of a wide array of antagonistic compounds of different structures, having between 5 to 8\% of the total genome devoted to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most important bioactive molecules from the genus Bacillus are non-ribosomally synthesized peptides and lipopeptides, polyketide compounds, bacteriocins and siderophores. Lipopeptides from Bacillus have very complex mechanisms of biosynthesis catalyzed by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), large enzyme complexes with modular structure, with each module being in charge for the incorporation of a particular amino acid. In general, they have a broad spectrum of antagonistic activity against plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses. Most important molecules from this group, circular lipopeptides from surfactin, iturin and fengycin families affect the target cells on the membrane level. Bacillus strains exhibit their biocontrol capacity predominantly through inhibitory activity on the growth of plant pathogens, as well as inducing systemic resistance in plants and competing for ecological niches with plant pathogens. Our previous studies showed the presence of multiple biosynthetic operons for synthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides in the collection of natural isolates of Bacillus, with many strains having more than one of them. Several strains of Bacillus sp. that we have recently characterized showed very strong antibacterial and antifungal activity against phytopathogens. The PCR analysis showed the presence of biosynthetic operons for iturin, bacillomycin, fengycin and surfactin in tested strains. Measurement of the kinetics of production of antimicrobial substances showed that, in most cases, synthesis started at the beginning of exponential phase of growth, reaching the maximum of antimicrobial activity at the beginning of the stationary growth phase and stayed at this level for the whole duration of observed period. Preparations of cell-free supernatants of tested strains were active against many fungal and bacterial pathogens, in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and HPTLC bioautography analysis of purified compounds confirmed the presence of lipopeptides of mentioned families, hence confirming the biocontrol capacity of Bacillus isolates.},

The current taxonomy of the B. cereus group and the status of separate species mainly rely on phenotypic characteristics. Bacillus thuringiensis strains display a similar repertoire of the potential virulence genes on the chromosome as B. cereus sensu stricto strains and it has been shown that these genes can also be actively expressed in B. thuringiensis strains. Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis strains are usually not discriminated in clinical diagnostics or food microbiology. Thus, the actual contribution of the two species to gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases is currently unknown. Most cases of food-borne outbreaks caused by the B. cereus group have been associated with concentrations above 105 CFU/g. However, cases of both emetic and diarrhoeal illness have been reported involving lower levels of B. cereus. The levels of B. cereus that can be considered as a risk for consumers are also valid for B. thuringiensis. There is no evidence that B. thuringiensis has the genetic determinants for the emetic toxin cereulide. The Panel has recommended the application of whole genome sequencing to provide unambiguous identification of strains used as biopesticides and the detailed characterisation of outbreak strains allowing discrimination of B. thuringiensis from B. cereus. Data gaps include: dose–response and behavioural characteristics of B. cereus group strains and specifically of B. thuringiensis. Field studies after application of B. thuringiensis biopesticides are needed to enable the establishment of pre-harvest intervals.},

Results from mutagenesis of those regulatory genes in AR156 and their heterologous expression in B. subtilis suggested that the spo0A-sinI-sinR genetic circuit is not only essential for biofilm formation and cell differentiation in AR156 but also able to functionally replace their counterparts in B. subtilis in a nearly indistinguishable fashion. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling in the wild type and the ΔBcspo0A and ΔBcsinI mutants further revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes, likely positively regulated by both Spo0A and SinI (via SinR) in AR156. Among them, 29 genes are predicted to be directly controlled by SinR, whose counterpart in B. subtilis is a biofilm master repressor. Collectively, our studies demonstrated the essential role of the spo0A-sinI-sinR regulatory circuit in biofilm formation, cell differentiation, and bacteria–host interactions in B. cereus AR156.},

The performance of the kits and their applicability to gastrointestinal simulation samples were evaluated. Then, the stability and production of enterotoxins Hbl and Nhe under gastrointestinal conditions were investigated. Enterotoxin production was absent or impaired at acidic pH, i.e., in gastric medium with pH 5.0 and lasagne verde with pH 5.5. B. cereus did produce enterotoxins Nhe and Hbl during anaerobic growth in intestinal medium at pH 7.0, but the toxins were instantly degraded by the enzymes in the host's digestive secretions. Preformed enterotoxins did not withstand gastrointestinal passage under the simulated conditions, which suggests that preformed enterotoxins in food do not contribute to the diarrheal food poisoning syndrome. In conclusion, diarrhea is probably caused by de novo enterotoxin production by B. cereus cells located closely to the host's intestinal epithelium.},

	abstract = {Summary: Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, motile, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that is widely distributed environmentally. While B. cereus is associated mainly with food poisoning, it is being increasingly reported to be a cause of serious and potentially fatal non-gastrointestinal-tract infections. The pathogenicity of B. cereus, whether intestinal or nonintestinal, is intimately associated with the production of tissue-destructive exoenzymes. Among these secreted toxins are four hemolysins, three distinct phospholipases, an emesis-inducing toxin, and proteases. The major hurdle in evaluating B. cereus when isolated from a clinical specimen is overcoming its stigma as an insignificant contaminant. Outside its notoriety in association with food poisoning and severe eye infections, this bacterium has been incriminated in a multitude of other clinical conditions such as anthrax-like progressive pneumonia, fulminant sepsis, and devastating central nervous system infections, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, intravenous drug abusers, and neonates. Its role in nosocomial acquired bacteremia and wound infections in postsurgical patients has also been well defined, especially when intravascular devices such as catheters are inserted. Primary cutaneous infections mimicking clostridial gas gangrene induced subsequent to trauma have also been well documented. B. cereus produces a potent β-lactamase conferring marked resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Antimicrobials noted to be effective in the empirical management of a B. cereus infection while awaiting antimicrobial susceptibility results for the isolate include ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.},

	abstract = {A Total Diet Study (TDS) can be a complementary approach to traditional monitoring and surveillance programs, which instead of focusing on compliance is designed to provide a solid basis for calculating population dietary exposure and assessing potential impact on public health. A TDS includes the selection of foods based on food consumption data to represent a large portion of a typical diet, their preparation to food as consumed and the subsequent pooling of related foods before analysis. There is already a wealth of international TDS data available, but to better enable comparisons it is important that methods are harmonised to the extent possible. The Working Group of experts provides a definition of the TDS approach highlighting its inherent value; it gives guidance for a harmonised methodology starting from the TDS planning to the collection of analytical results, exposure assessment calculation and communication of TDS results; and it proposes a general approach to facilitate the use of TDS information at international level. A TDS can be used for screening purposes or as a more refined exposure assessment tool. It provides background concentration and exposure levels of chemical substances in a range of representative foods prepared for consumption, while monitoring and surveillance programs can better capture highly contaminated individual food items. Their complementarities would allow the identification of the relative importance of individual sources of chemical substances from the whole diet. In conclusion, a TDS is considered to be a good complement to existing food monitoring or surveillance programs to estimate population dietary exposure to beneficial and harmful chemical substances across the entire diet. Harmonising the TDS methodology will enhance the value of these programs by improving the comparability at international level.},

	abstract = {Furan is generally produced during thermal processing of various foods including baked, fried, and roasted food items such as cereal products, coffee, canned, and jarred prepared foods as well as in baby foods. Furan is a toxic and carcinogenic compound to humans and may be a vital hazard to infants and babies. Furan could be formed in foods through thermal degradation of carbohydrates, dissociation of amino acids, and oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The detection of furan in food products is difficult due to its high volatility and low molecular weight. Headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is generally used for analysis of furan in food samples. The risk assessment of furan can be characterized using margin of exposure approach (MOE). Conventional strategies including cooking in open vessels, reheating of commercially processed foods with stirring, and physical removal using vacuum treatment have remained unsuccessful for the removal of furan due to the complex production mechanisms and possible precursors of furan. The innovative food-processing technologies such as high-pressure processing (HPP), high-pressure thermal sterilization (HPTS), and Ohmic heating have been adapted for the reduction of furan levels in baby foods. But in recent years, only HPP has gained interest due to successful reduction of furan because of its nonthermal mechanism. HPP-treated baby food products are commercially available from different food companies. This review summarizes the mechanism involved in the formation of furan in foods, its toxicity, and identification in infant foods and presents a solution for limiting its formation, occurrence, and retention using novel strategies.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are considered emerging persistent organic pollutants, which are chemically, thermally, and biologically stable, or degrade to persistent end products. Dietary intake is considered as one of the main human exposure pathways of these chemicals and, having entered the human body, PFASs are not metabolised and accumulate in tissues, while their toxicological properties may cause various health problems. Several studies on the occurrence of PFASs in various food types have been conducted, including the assessment of dietary exposure. The most important sources were fish, meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables recently showed relatively high levels of PFASs, and have become a more significant source of PFASs than meat. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion, setting the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng kg-1 b.w. for the sum of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulphonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS). The emphasis in this paper is on the systematization of available information on the distribution of PFASs and their levels in different food, with a special interest in data from the Europe. The current legislation and estimated dietary intakes by the general population are described. While the available information on tolerably daily intakes estimated in a number of European countries often exceeds the newly established EFSA TWI, a critical evaluation of performance characteristics of the reviewed analytical methodologies revealed the insufficient sensitivity of quantification procedures for accurate risk assessment according to the guidelines proposed by EFSA.},

We have revised studies conducted in various Asian, American and European countries. However, information is rather limited, with no recent data for most countries over the world. Due to the enormous differences in the methodologies of the studies, to conduct a detailed comparison of the results for the different regions and countries has not been possible. Notwithstanding, where data over time are available, important reductions have been observed. These reductions have been linked to the decreases in the environmental emissions of PCDD/Fs noted in recent years. Interestingly, reductions in the levels of PCDD/Fs in biological tissues are also occurring in parallel. In general, the tolerable daily/weekly/monthly dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs are not being currently exceeded where data are available.},

FCMs/FCAs can cause chemical contamination of food when migration of their chemical constituents (known as food contact chemicals, FCCs) occurs. Some FCCs are known to be hazardous. However, the total extent of exposure to FCCs, as well as their health and environmental effects, remain unknown, because information on chemical structures, use patterns, migration potential, and health effects of FCCs is often absent or scattered across multiple sources. Therefore, we initiated a research project to systematically collect, analyze, and publicly share information on FCCs. As a first step, we compiled a database of intentionally added food contact chemicals (FCCdb), presented here. The FCCdb lists 12′285 substances that could possibly be used worldwide to make FCMs/FCAs, identified based on 67 FCC lists from publicly available sources, such as regulatory lists and industry inventories. We further explored FCCdb chemicals’ hazards using several authoritative sources of hazard information, including (i) classifications for health and environmental hazards under the globally harmonized system for classification and labeling of chemicals (GHS), (ii) the identification of chemicals of concern due to endocrine disruption or persistence related hazards, and (iii) the inclusion on selected EU- or US-relevant regulatory lists of hazardous chemicals. This analysis prioritized 608 hazardous FCCs for further assessment and substitution in FCMs/FCAs. Evaluation based on non-authoritative, predictive hazard data (e.g., by in silico modeling or literature analysis) highlighted an additional 1411 FCCdb substances that could thus present similar levels of concern, but have not been officially classified so far. Lastly, for over a quarter of all FCCdb chemicals no hazard information could be found in the sources consulted, revealing a significant data gap and research need.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a well-recognized environmental contaminant that occurs naturally through geogenic processes in the aquifer. More than 200 million people around the world are potentially exposed to the elevated level of arsenic mostly from Asia and Latin America. Many adverse health effects including skin diseases (i.e., arsenicosis, hyperkeratosis, pigmentation changes), carcinogenesis, and neurological diseases have been reported due to arsenic exposure. In addition, arsenic has recently been shown to contribute to the onset of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced diabetes are pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and death, impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance and reduced cellular glucose transport. Whereas, the most proposed mechanisms of arsenic-induced hypertension are oxidative stress, disruption of nitric oxide signaling, altered vascular response to neurotransmitters and impaired vascular muscle calcium (Ca2+) signaling, damage of renal, and interference with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, the contributions of arsenic exposure to non-communicable diseases are complex and multifaceted, and little information is available about the molecular mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced non-communicable diseases and also no suitable therapeutic target identified yet. Therefore, in the future, more basic research is necessary to identify the appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment and management of arsenic-induced non-communicable diseases. Several reports demonstrated that a daily balanced diet with proper nutrient supplements (vitamins, micronutrients, natural antioxidants) has shown effective to reduce the damages caused by arsenic exposure. Arsenic detoxication through natural compounds or nutraceuticals is considered a cost-effective treatment/management and researchers should focus on these alternative options. This review paper explores the scenarios of arsenic contamination in groundwater with an emphasis on public health concerns. It also demonstrated arsenic sources, biogeochemistry, toxicity mechanisms with therapeutic targets, arsenic exposure-related human diseases, and onsets of cardiovascular diseases as well as feasible management options for arsenic toxicity.},

	abstract = {Alternaria molds can produce a variety of different mycotoxins, often resulting in food contamination with chemical mixtures, posing a challenge for risk assessment. Some of these metabolites possess estrogenic properties, an effect whose toxicological relevance is questioned in the light of the strong genotoxic and cytotoxic properties of co-occurring toxins. Thus, we tested a complex extract from A. alternata for estrogenic properties in Ishikawa cells. By assessing alkaline phosphatase activity, we did not observe estrogen receptor (ER) activation at non-cytotoxic concentrations (≤ 10 µg/ml). Furthermore, an extract stripped of highly genotoxic perylene quinones also did not mediate estrogenic effects, despite diminished genotoxic properties in the comet assay (≥ 10 µg/ml). Interestingly, both extracts impaired the estrogenicity of 17β-estradiol (E2) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (5-10 µg/ml), indicating anti-estrogenic effects which could not be explained by the presence of known mycoestrogens. A mechanism for this unexpected result might be the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by Alternaria metabolites, as indicated by the induction of CYP1A1 transcription. While a direct influence on the metabolism of E2 could not be confirmed by LC-MS/MS, literature describing a direct interplay of the AhR with estrogenic pathways points to a corresponding mode of action. Taken together, the present study indicates AhR-mediated anti-estrogenic effects as a novel mechanism of naturally co-occurring Alternaria toxin mixtures. Furthermore, our results confirm their genotoxic activity and raise questions about the contribution of still undiscovered metabolites to toxicological properties.},

	abstract = {Bacillus licheniformis can cause foodborne intoxication due to the production of the surfactant lichenysin. The aim of this study was to measure the production of lichenysin by food isolates of B. lichenformis in LB medium and skimmed milk and its cytotoxicity for intestinal cells. 
Out of 11 B. licheniformis isolates tested, most showed robust growth in high salt (1M NaCl), 4\% ethanol, at 37°C or 55°C, and aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All strains produced lichenysin (in varying amounts), but not all strains were hemolytic. Production of this stable compound by selected strains (high producers B4094 and B4123, and type strain DSM13T) was subsequently determined using LB medium and milk, at 37°C and 55°C. Lichenysin production in LB broth and milk was not detected at cell densities {\textless} 5 log10 CFU/ml. The highest concentrations were found in the stationary phase of growth. Total production of lichenysin was 4-20 times lower in milk than in LB broth (maximum 36 µg/ml), and {\textasciitilde}10 times lower in the biomass obtained from milk agar than LB agar. Under all conditions tested, strain B4094 consistently yielded the highest amounts. Besides strain variation and medium composition, temperature also had an effect on lichenysin production, with two-fold lower amounts of lichenysin produced at 55°C than at 37°C. All three strains produced lichenysin A with varying acyl chain lengths (C11 to C18). The relative abundance of the C14 variant was highest in milk and the C15 variant highest in LB. The concentration of lichenysin needed to reduce cell viability by 50\% (IC50) was 16.6 µg/ml for Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells and 16.8 µg/ml for pig ileum organoids.
Taken together, the presence of low levels ({\textless} 5 log10 CFU/ml) of B. licheniformis in foods is unlikely to pose a foodborne hazard related to lichenysin production. However, depending on the strain present, the composition, and storage condition of the food, a risk of foodborne intoxication may arise if growth to high levels is supported and such product is ingested.},

It considers the effect of changes in temperature/water availability on mycotoxin contamination, especially incidences where aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A production has been influenced. The potential of using preharvest models to predict risk from deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat, fumonisin B1 in maize and aflatoxins in maize and peanuts in different continents are considered in the context of potential for adaptation to include climate-change scenarios. Available information suggests that slightly elevated CO2 concentrations and interactions with temperature and water availability may stimulate growth of some mycotoxigenic species, especially under water stress. The accumulated knowledge on interacting conditions of water/temperature effects on optimum and boundary conditions for growth and mycotoxin production has been used to predict the effects that +3 and +5°C increases under water stress would have on growth/mycotoxin production by mycotoxigenic species. Various spatial scales, from toxin gene expression to regional approaches using geostatistics, are examined for their use in understanding the impact that climate change may have on food contamination in developing and developed countries. The potential for using an integrated systems approach to link gene expression data, phenotypic toxin production under different interacting abiotic conditions is discussed using Fusarium species and DON as examples. Such approaches may be beneficial for more accurate predictions of risk from mycotoxins on a regional basis and also the potential for new emerging toxin threats.},

	abstract = {As part of the previous French Total Diet Studies (TDS) focusing on exposure to food chemicals in the population aged 3 years and older, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health \& Safety (ANSES) launched a specific TDS on infants to complete its overall chemical food safety programme for the general population. More than 500 chemical substances were analysed in food products consumed by children under 3 years old, including nutrients, several endocrine disruptors resulting from human activities (polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins and furans, brominated flame retardants, perfluoroalkyl acids, pesticide residues, etc.) or migrating from food contact materials such as bisphenol A or phthalates, but also natural substances such as mycotoxins, phytoestrogens and steroids. To obtain a representative and general view of infant food consumption, food items were selected based on results of a national consumption survey conducted specifically on this population. Moreover, a specific study on food was conducted on 429 households to determine which home-cooking practices are employed to prepare food consumed by infants. Overall, the targeted chemical substances were analysed in more than 450 food samples, representing the purchase and home-cooking practices of over 5500 food products. Foods included common foods such as vegetables, fruit or cakes as well as specific infant foods such as infant formula or jarred baby food. The sampling plan covered over 80\% of the total diet. Specificities in infant food consumption and habits were therefore considered to define this first infant TDS. This study, conducted on a large scale and focusing on a particularly sensitive population, will provide accurate information on the dietary exposure of children under 3 years to food chemicals, especially endocrine disruptors, and will be particularly useful for risk assessment analysis under the remit of ANSES’ expert committees.},

	abstract = {A Total Diet Study (TDS) can be a complementary approach to traditional monitoring and surveillance programs, which instead of focusing on compliance is designed to provide a solid basis for calculating population dietary exposure and assessing potential impact on public health. A TDS includes the selection of foods based on food consumption data to represent a large portion of a typical diet, their preparation to food as consumed and the subsequent pooling of related foods before analysis. There is already a wealth of international TDS data available, but to better enable comparisons it is important that methods are harmonised to the extent possible. The Working Group of experts provides a definition of the TDS approach highlighting its inherent value; it gives guidance for a harmonised methodology starting from the TDS planning to the collection of analytical results, exposure assessment calculation and communication of TDS results; and it proposes a general approach to facilitate the use of TDS information at international level. A TDS can be used for screening purposes or as a more refined exposure assessment tool. It provides background concentration and exposure levels of chemical substances in a range of representative foods prepared for consumption, while monitoring and surveillance programs can better capture highly contaminated individual food items. Their complementarities would allow the identification of the relative importance of individual sources of chemical substances from the whole diet. In conclusion, a TDS is considered to be a good complement to existing food monitoring or surveillance programs to estimate population dietary exposure to beneficial and harmful chemical substances across the entire diet. Harmonising the TDS methodology will enhance the value of these programs by improving the comparability at international level.},

	abstract = {Perceived healthiness (PH) has been the subject of intensive research over the last years, mainly due to its huge impact on food choice. Nonetheless, consumers’ perceptions of healthiness have predominantly been investigated from the quantitative perspective. This systematic review identified 60 qualitative studies to answer the following questions: How has the PH of foods been investigated and explored? How the importance of food healthiness (FH) influence consumer attitudes and food choices? How has FH been important to reinforce consumers’ expectations? What opportunities and barriers can be identified in terms of ethical, sustainable, and environmental motivations? Content analysis identified five dimensions: ‘misconception, knowledge or cognition’, ‘pleasure’, ‘healthiness importance’, ‘purity’, and ‘environmentally friendly or ethical issues’. We suggested that information about self-directed benefits can affect both the expectation and tasting of foods. Overall, the desire for more palatable “healthy” foods may explain a growing attention for future foods providing good feelings (e.g., green comfort foods). Making health policies and educational interventions may help increase the importance of healthiness in a stimulus-independent manner to maximize potential healthier choices, influencing sensory pathways. In this regard, it is important that the industry, consumers, and government priorities be aligned with in the future.},

By utilizing this structured approach to assess the likelihood and consequence of exposure to hazards, risk assessments have supported comprehensive evaluations of the efficacy of food control systems and advanced procedures for improving food safety. Risk assessment is the science-based component of risk analysis, comprising four key steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. While it is a resource and data intensive endeavor, it can objectively identify and describe the risks posed by foodborne hazards, including pathogens, chemical contaminants, food additives, physical hazards, and allergens. The outputs of a risk assessment can then be used to support the development of risk mitigation strategies, including the development of stringent standards for food, labeling to inform susceptible sub-populations, or banning an additive or food containing certain contaminants. While risk assessment has been widely used by standard setting agencies to establish microbiological criteria and set maximum limits for contaminants and additives, it can also be used by dairy manufacturers to better understand the significance of hazards along their supply chains, and to assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies designed to manage the risk.},

Out of 25 exposed children, 12 exhibited symptoms of nausea, headache and vomiting 5-8 hours after eating breakfast which consisted of sandwiches made of sliced bread and rolled ham together with milk and cocoa reconstituted from milk and cocoa powder. Food analysis regarding contamination with potentially toxigenic food borne bacteria which was performed according to ISO Standards revealed no pathogenic microflora, including rotaviruses and adenoviruses. The same applies to the swabs of hands, noses, throats of the kitchen staff and from working surfaces and utensils from the kindergarten. Analysis of stool samples taken from staff as well as infected children also revealed no pathogenic microorganisms. The samples of milk and cocoa powder were examined in parallel using nonselective media. Contamination of milk powder with toxin producing B. licheniformis and B. subtilis was proved by vacuolation assay and MTT cell culture test. The examination of reconstituted milk performed in our lab showed that both species of Bacillus were able to enter the log phase of growth within 2 hours storage of the reconstituted milk at room temperature. Therefore, it was concluded that the main error in milk powder handling was to prepare the milk and cocoa beverage 2 hours prior to consumption without boiling instead of preparing it immediately before consumption taking care to boil the beverage. The application of the main HACCP principles is therefore recommended in order to avoid such incidents in small kindergartens.},

Investigation of specific alleles revealed high numbers of isolates carrying toxin-associated genes including cytK (53.62\%), hblA (59.42\%), hblC (44.93\%), hblD (53.62\%), nheA (84.06\%), nheB (89.86\%) and nheC (84.06\%) with isolates belonging to groups IV and V having significant higher prevalence of hblACD and group IV of CytK genes. Strains from dairy products had significantly lower prevalence of CytK and hblACD genes compared to isolates from equipment and raw milk/bulk tanks. Genes related to sucrose metabolism were detected at higher frequency in isolates obtained from raw milk compared to strains from equipment and utensils. The population genomic analysis demonstrated the diversity of strains and variability of putative function among B. cereus group isolates in Brazilian dairy production, with large numbers of strains potentially able to cause foodborne illness. This detailed information will contribute to targeted interventions to reduce milk contamination and spoilage associated with B. cereus in Brazil.},

Commercial cream samples were stored aerobically at 4, 8, 12 and 15 °C for a maximum time period of 40 days. At appropriate time intervals, cream samples were subjected to: (i) microbiological analyses, and (ii) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, the spoilage microbiota was identified through repetitive extragenic palindrome-PCR, while selected isolates were further characterized based on sequencing of the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial growth was observed only during storage of cream samples at 12 and 15 °C, with the applied genotypic analysis demonstrating that Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis was the dominant spoilage microorganism of this product. Based on the HPLC analysis results, citric acid and sucrose were the most abundant organic acid and sugar, respectively throughout storage of cream pudding, whereas notable changes mainly included: (i) increase in the concentration of lactic acid and to a lesser extent of formic and acetic acids, and (ii) increase in the concentration of glucose and fructose at the expense of sucrose and lactose. The results of this study should be useful for the dairy industry in detecting and controlling microbiological spoilage in cream pudding and other chilled, neutral-pH dairy desserts.},

Endospores are formed by bacteria in a complex process within their mother cells and enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods. The diversity of endospore-forming bacteria is broad with more than 25 genera known to date. Nevertheless, endospores are formed almost exclusively by low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, including the genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Thermoactinomyces, Sporolactobacillus, and Sporosarcina. The two largest genera that are also the most important for food microbiology are the rod-shaped anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic Bacillus and the strictly anaerobic Clostridium. Bacteria of both genera are known to produce food spoilage. Their spores survive extreme heat and other stresses, such as radiation or biocidal chemicals, making the preservation of food challenging. Some of these spore-forming bacteria also cause food poisoning due to various toxins produced and may cause mild (Bacillus subtilis), severe (Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens), or life-threatening (Clostridium botulinum) diseases.},

The usually aerobic production via fermentation of Bacillus subtilis is accompanied by vigorous foaming which leads to complex constructions and great expense. Therefore it is reasonable to search for alternative foam-free production processes. The current study introduces a novel approach to produce Surfactin in a foam-free process applying a strictly anaerobic bioreactor cultivation. The process was performed several times with different glucose concentrations in mineral salt medium. The fermentations were analyzed regarding specific (qSurfactin, vol. qSurfactin) and overall product yields (YP/X, YP/S) as well as substrate utilization (YX/S). Fermentations in which 2.5 g/L glucose were employed proofed to be the most effective, reaching product yields of YP/X = 0.278 g/g. Most interesting, the product yields exceeded classical aerobic fermentations, in which foam fractionation was applied. Additionally, values for specific production rate qSurfactin (0.005 g/(g∙h)) and product yield per consumed substrate (YP/S = 0.033 g/g) surpass results of comparable foam-free processes. The current study introduces an alternative to produce a biosurfactant that overcomes the challenges of severe foaming and need for additional constructions.},

	abstract = {The anaerobic growth of B. subtilis to synthesize surfactin poses an alternative strategy to conventional aerobic cultivations. In general, the strong foam formation observed during aerobic processes represents a major obstacle. Anaerobic processes have, amongst others, the distinct advantage that the total bioreactor volume can be exploited as foaming does not occur. Recent studies also reported on promising product per biomass yields. However, anaerobic growth in comparison to aerobic processes has several disadvantages. For example, the overall titers are comparably low and cultivations are time-consuming due to low growth rates. B. subtilis JABs24, a derivate of strain 168 with the ability to synthesize surfactin, was used as model strain in this study. Ammonium and nitrite were hypothesized to negatively influence anaerobic growth. Ammonium with initial concentrations up to 0.2 mol/L was shown to have no significant impact on growth, but increasing concentrations resulted in decreased surfactin titers and reduced nitrate reductase expression. Anaerobic cultivations spiked with increasing nitrite concentrations resulted in prolonged lag-phases. Indeed, growth rates were in a similar range after the lag-phase indicating that nitrite has a neglectable effect on the observed decreasing growth rates. In bioreactor cultivations, the specific growth rate decreased with increasing glucose concentrations during the time course of both batch and fed-batch processes to less than 0.05 1/h. In addition, surfactin titers, overall YP/X and YP/S were 53\%, ∼42\%, and ∼57\% lower than in serum flask with 0.190 g/L, 0.344 g/g and 0.015 g/g. The YX/S, on the contrary, was 30\% lower in the serum flask with 0.044 g/g. The productivities q were similar with ∼0.005 g/(g⋅h). However, acetate strongly accumulated during cultivation and was posed as further metabolite that might negatively influence anaerobic growth. Acetate added to anaerobic cultivations in a range from 0 g/L up to 10 g/L resulted in a reduced maximum and overall growth rate μ by 44\% and 30\%, respectively. To conclude, acetate was identified as a promising target for future process enhancement and strain engineering. Though, the current study demonstrates that the anaerobic cultivation to synthesize surfactin represents a reasonable perspective and feasible alternative to conventional processes.},

Indeed, several studies have linked alterations in the gut microbiota with the development of different diseases.

The presence of different species of bifidobacteria changes with age, from childhood to old age. Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. bifidum are generally dominant in infants, whereas B. catenulatum, B. adolescentis and, as well as B. longum are more prevalent in adults. Increasingly, evidence is accumulating which shows beneficial effects of supplementation with bifidobacteria for the improvement of human health conditions ranging from protection against infection to different extra- and intra-intestinal positive effects. Moreover, bifidobacteria have been associated with the production of a number of potentially health promoting metabolites including short chain fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid and bacteriocins. The aim of this mini-review is to describe the bifidobacteria compositional changes associated with different stages in life, highlighting their beneficial role, as well as their presence or absence in many disease states.},

Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual's starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live probiotics. The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize. Enterotypes have been proposed using metrics such as alpha species diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla, and the relative abundance of beneficial genera (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia) versus facultative anaerobes (E. coli), pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus, or nonbacterial microbes. Microbiota composition and relative populations of bacterial species are linked to physiologic health along different axes. We review the role of diet quality, carbohydrate intake, fermentable FODMAPs, and prebiotic fiber in maintaining healthy gut flora. The implications are discussed for various conditions including obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, depression, and cardiovascular disease.},

In recent years, fermented foods have undergone a surge in popularity, mainly due to their proposed health benefits. The aim of this review is to define and characterise common fermented foods (kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, tempeh, natto, miso, kimchi, sourdough bread), their mechanisms of action (including impact on the microbiota), and the evidence for effects on gastrointestinal health and disease in humans. Putative mechanisms for the impact of fermented foods on health include the potential probiotic effect of their constituent microorganisms, the fermentation-derived production of bioactive peptides, biogenic amines, and conversion of phenolic compounds to biologically active compounds, as well as the reduction of anti-nutrients. Fermented foods that have been tested in at least one randomised controlled trial (RCT) for their gastrointestinal effects were kefir, sauerkraut, natto, and sourdough bread. Despite extensive in vitro studies, there are no RCTs investigating the impact of kombucha, miso, kimchi or tempeh in gastrointestinal health. The most widely investigated fermented food is kefir, with evidence from at least one RCT suggesting beneficial effects in both lactose malabsorption and Helicobacter pylori eradication. In summary, there is very limited clinical evidence for the effectiveness of most fermented foods in gastrointestinal health and disease. Given the convincing in vitro findings, clinical high-quality trials investigating the health benefits of fermented foods are warranted.},

	abstract = {There was a long-held belief that the gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a strict aerobe. But recent studies have shown that B. subtilis will grow anaerobically, either by using nitrate or nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor, or by fermentation. How B. subtilis alters its metabolic activity according to the availability of oxygen and alternative electron acceptors is but one focus of study. A two-component signal transduction system composed of a sensor kinase, ResE, and a response regulator, ResD, occupies an early stage in the regulatory pathway governing anaerobic respiration. One of the essential roles of ResD and ResE in anaerobic gene regulation is induction of fnr transcription upon oxygen limitation. FNR is a transcriptional activator for anaerobically induced genes, including those for respiratory nitrate reductase, narGHJI.B. subtilis has two distinct nitrate reductases, one for the assimilation of nitrate nitrogen and the other for nitrate respiration. In contrast, one nitrite reductase functions both in nitrite nitrogen assimilation and nitrite respiration. Unlike many anaerobes, which use pyruvate formate lyase, B. subtilis can carry out fermentation in the absence of external electron acceptors wherein pyruvate dehydrogenase is utilized to metabolize pyruvate.},

However, there are challenges to improving food security and safety on a global scale; the major question is how food safety can be guaranteed while increasing the complexity of food supply chains. A food produced in a certain location usually contains ingredients, additives, and preservatives from different and distant origins. Although countries take several food control measures, their institutional and regulatory frameworks diverge widely, as do the definitions of food crisis, food incidents, and risk management approaches. The present review discusses some past food safety issues and lessons learned. Convergences and differences in the regulatory framework of food control agencies in different regions of the world are herein revealed. Emerging risks are also discussed, particularly the spread of antibiotic resistance in the food chain and the environment, as well as the rise of new antibiotic-resistant pathogenic strains with broader tolerance to environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Safe food is the right of every citizen of the European Union (EU). A comprehensive and dynamic framework of food and feed safety legislation has been put in place and the EU's executive arm – the European Commission – is responsible for ensuring that the EU member states apply food law consistently. Similarly, the Commission plays an important role in ensuring that imported food meets the EU's stringent food safety standards. Consumer perceptions of unsafe food tend to focus on acute outbreaks of bacterial or viral origin. In recent years there have been a number of diverse food crises associated with fraudulent activity which may (e.g. melamine in dairy products in China) or may not (e.g. the horse meat scandal in the EU) represent a genuine food safety risk. Well publicized incidents of chronic exposure to chemical contamination in the EU (e.g. dioxins in meat and mycotoxins in nuts) have required robust coordinated policy responses from the Commission. Despite the decreasing incidence of non-compliant residues of veterinary medicinal products and banned substances in animal products, EU consumers are increasingly concerned about the use of such products in food-producing animals, including in the context of the build-up of antimicrobial resistance in animals and transfer to humans. The Commission plays a key role in coordination of the EU member states' responses to such incidents, in risk management, and in preparation for emerging issues. This paper focuses on how the EU as a whole has dealt with a number of food crises, and what can be learned from past incidents. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The opportunistic food-borne gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes can exist as a free-living microorganism in the environment and grow in the cytoplasm of vertebrate and invertebrate cells following infection. The general stress response, controlled by the alternative sigma factor, sigmaB, has an important role for bacterial survival both in the environment and during infection. We used quantitative real-time PCR analysis and immuno-blot analysis to examine sigmaB expression during growth of L. monocytogenes EGD-e. Whole genome-based transcriptional profiling was used to identify sigmaB-dependent genes at different growth phases.
RESULTS: We detected 105 sigmaB-positively regulated genes and 111 genes which appeared to be under negative control of sigmaB and validated 36 sigmaB-positively regulated genes in vivo using a reporter gene fusion system.
CONCLUSION: Genes comprising the sigmaB regulon encode solute transporters, novel cell-wall proteins, universal stress proteins, transcriptional regulators and include those involved in osmoregulation, carbon metabolism, ribosome- and envelope-function, as well as virulence and niche-specific survival genes such as those involved in bile resistance and exclusion. Ten of the sigmaB-positively regulated genes of L. monocytogenes are absent in L. innocua. A total of 75 sigmaB-positively regulated listerial genes had homologs in B. subtilis, but only 33 have been previously described as being sigmaB-regulated in B. subtilis even though both species share a highly conserved sigmaB-dependent consensus sequence. A low overlap of genes may reflects adaptation of these bacteria to their respective environmental conditions.},

In this study a proteomic approach was used to define components of the sigmaB regulon in L. monocytogenes 10403S (serotype 1/2a). Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the recently developed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technique, the protein expression profiles of the wild type and an isogenic delta sigB deletion strain were compared. Overall, this study identified 38 proteins whose expression was sigmaB dependent; 17 of these proteins were found to require the presence of sigmaB for full expression, while 21 were expressed at a higher level in the delta sigB mutant background. The data obtained with the two proteomic approaches showed limited overlap (four proteins were identified by both methods), a finding that highlights the complementarity of the two technologies. Overall, the proteomic data reaffirmed a role for sigmaB in the general stress response and highlighted a probable role for sigmaB in metabolism, especially in the utilization of alternative carbon sources. Proteomic and physiological data revealed the involvement of sigmaB in glycerol metabolism. Five newly identified members of the sigmaB regulon were shown to be under direct regulation of sigmaB using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), while random amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was used to map four sigmaB-dependent promoters upstream from lmo0796, lmo1830, lmo2391, and lmo2695. Using RT-PCR analysis of known and newly identified sigmaB-dependent genes, as well as proteomic analyses, sigmaB was shown to play a major role in the stationary phase of growth in complex media.},

	abstract = {The gene encoding the alternative sigma factor sigma(B) in Listeria monocytogenes is induced upon exposure of cells to several stresses. In this study, we investigated the impact of a sigB null mutation on the survival of L. monocytogenes EGD-e at low pH, during high-hydrostatic-pressure treatment, and during freezing. The survival of Delta sigB mutant exponential-phase cells at pH 2.5 was 10,000-fold lower than the survival of EGD-e wild-type cells. Moreover, the Delta sigB mutant failed to show an acid tolerance response. Upon preexposure for 1 h to pH 4.5, the survival at pH 2.5 was 100,000-fold lower for the Delta sigB mutant than for the wild type. The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) acid resistance system is important in survival and adaptation of L. monocytogenes in acidic conditions. The sigma(B) dependence of the gad genes (gadA, gadB, gadC, gadD, and gadE) was analyzed in silico. Putative sigma(B)-dependent promoter sites were found upstream of the gadCB operon (encoding a glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter and a glutamate decarboxylase, respectively) and the lmo2434 gene (gadD, encoding a putative glutamate decarboxylase). Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that expression of the gadCB operon and expression of gadD are indeed sigma(B) dependent. In addition, a proteomics approach was used to analyze the protein expression profiles upon acid exposure. Although the GAD proteins were not recovered, nine proteins accumulated in the wild type but not in the Delta sigB strain. These proteins included Pfk, GalE, ClpP, and Lmo1580. Exposure to pH 4.5, in order to preload cells with active sigma(B) and consequently with sigma (B)-dependent general stress proteins, also provided considerable protection against high-hydrostatic-pressure treatment and freezing. The combined data argue that the expression of sigma(B)-dependent genes provides L. monocytogenes with nonspecific multiple-stress resistance that may be relevant for survival in the natural environment as well as during food processing.},

	volume = {6},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0016151},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a number of gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria, the general stress response is regulated by the alternative sigma factor B (SigB). Common stressors which lead to the activation of SigB and the SigB-dependent regulon are high osmolarity, acid and several more. Recently is has been shown that also blue and red light activates SigB in Bacillus subtilis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By qRT-PCR we analyzed the transcriptional response of the pathogen L. monocytogenes to blue and red light in wild type bacteria and in isogenic deletion mutants for the putative blue-light receptor Lmo0799 and the stress sigma factor SigB. It was found that both blue (455 nm) and red (625 nm) light induced the transcription of sigB and SigB-dependent genes, this induction was completely abolished in the SigB mutant. The blue-light effect was largely dependent on Lmo0799, proving that this protein is a genuine blue-light receptor. The deletion of lmo0799 enhanced the red-light effect, the underlying mechanism as well as that of SigB activation by red light remains unknown. Blue light led to an increased transcription of the internalin A/B genes and of bacterial invasiveness for Caco-2 enterocytes. Exposure to blue light also strongly inhibited swimming motility of the bacteria in a Lmo0799- and SigB-dependent manner, red light had no effect there.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data established that visible, in particular blue light is an important environmental signal with an impact on gene expression and physiology of the non-phototrophic bacterium L. monocytogenes. In natural environments these effects will result in sometimes random but potentially also cyclic fluctuations of gene activity, depending on the light conditions prevailing in the respective habitat.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can survive under a wide range of environmental and energy stress conditions. The general stress response controlled by sigma(B) largely contributes to stress resistance in L. monocytogenes. Moreover, the bacterial cell wall is the first defense against cellular stress and as such is the target of numerous antibiotics. We therefore hypothesize that sigma(B) contributes to monitoring the integrity of cell walls. We evaluated sigma(B) activity in wild type and DeltasigB mutant L. monocytogenes containing reporter fusions (sigma(B)-dependent opuCA promoter and a lacZ reporter gene) during the early exponential growth phase by measuring the specific activity of beta-galactosidase after vancomycin (2 microg mL(-1) final concentration) stress. sigma(B) activity is significantly induced only in the wild-type strain by addition of vancomycin. In addition, we identified sigma(B)-dependent vancomycin-inducible proteins using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Two independent proteomic analyses confirmed the minimum twofold upregulation of 18 vancomycin-inducible sigma(B)-dependent stress response proteins in the wild-type strain compared with the DeltasigB mutant. The functions of these proteins are associated with cell wall biogenesis, intracellular transport, general stress response, cell metabolism and virulence. These results suggest that the sigma(B) protein may contribute to the monitoring of cell wall integrity.},

	abstract = {In Listeria monocytogenes, the full details of how stress signals are integrated into the σB regulatory pathway are not yet available. To help shed light on this question, we investigated a collection of transposon mutants that were predicted to have compromised activity of the alternative sigma factor B (σB). These mutants were tested for acid tolerance, a trait that is known to be under σB regulation, and they were found to display increased acid sensitivity, similar to a mutant lacking σB (ΔsigB). The transposon insertions were confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, but in each case, the strains were also found to carry a frameshift mutation in the sigB operon. The changes were predicted to result in premature stop codons, with negative consequences for σB activation, independently of the transposon location. Reduced σB activation in these mutants was confirmed. Growth measurements under conditions similar to those used during the construction of the transposon library revealed that the frameshifted sigB operon alleles conferred a growth advantage at higher temperatures, during late exponential phase. Mixed-culture experiments at 42°C demonstrated that the loss of σB activity allowed mutants to take over a population of parental bacteria. Together, our results suggest that mutations affecting σB activity can arise during laboratory culture because of the growth advantage conferred by these mutations under mild stress conditions. The data highlight the significant cost of stress protection in this foodborne pathogen and emphasize the need for whole-genome sequence analysis of newly constructed strains to confirm the expected genotype.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we investigated a collection of Listeria monocytogenes strains that all carried sigB operon mutations. The mutants all had reduced σB activity and were found to have a growth advantage under conditions of mild heat stress (42°C). In mixed cultures, these mutants outcompeted the wild type when mild heat stress was present but not at an optimal growth temperature. An analysis of 22,340 published L. monocytogenes genome sequences found a high rate of premature stop codons present in genes positively regulating σB activity. Together, these findings suggest that the occurrence of mutations that attenuate σB activity can be favored under conditions of mild stress, probably highlighting the burden on cellular resources that stems from deploying the general stress response.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of three common carbon sources, namely glucose, glycerol and lactose, on growth and activation of the general stress response Sigma factor, SigB, and corresponding phenotypes including stress resistance. A fluorescent reporter coupled to the promoter of lmo2230, a highly SigB-dependent gene, was used to determine SigB activation via quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy. This approach, combined with Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy, showed the highest SigB activation in lactose grown cells and lowest in glucose grown cells. In line with this observation, lactose grown cells showed the highest resistance to lethal heat and acid stress, the highest biofilm formation, and had the highest adhesion/invasion capacity in Caco-2-derived C2Bbe1 cell lines. Our data suggest that lactose utilisation triggers a strong SigB dependent stress response and this may have implications for the resistance of L. monocytogenes along the food chain.},

Survival experiments revealed that during the growth arrest the cells became tolerant to the antibiotic and the culture was able to resume growth some time after rifampin treatment. l-[35S]methionine pulse-labeled protein extracts were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to investigate the change in the protein synthesis pattern in response to rifampin. The ςB-dependent general stress proteins were found to be induced after treatment with the antibiotic. Part of the oxidative stress signature was induced as indicated by the catalase KatA and MrgA. The target protein of rifampin, the β subunit (RpoB) of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the flagellin protein Hag belonging to the ςD regulon were also induced. The rifampin-triggered growth arrest was extended in a sigB mutant in comparison to the wild-type strain, and the higher the concentration, the more pronounced this effect was. Activity of the RsbP energy-signaling phosphatase in the ςB signal transduction network was also important for this protection against rifampin, but the RsbU environmental signaling phosphatase was not required. The sigB mutant strain was less capable of growing on rifampin-containing agar plates. When plated from a culture that had already reached stationary phase without previous exposure to the antibiotic during growth, the survival rate of the wild type exceeded that of the sigB mutant by a factor of 100. We conclude that the general stress response of B. subtilis is induced by rifampin depending on RsbP activity and that loss of SigB function causes increased sensitivity to the antibiotic.},

	abstract = {sigma B is a secondary sigma factor that controls the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis. sigma B-dependent transcription is induced by the activation of sigma B itself, a process that involves release of sigma B from an inhibitory complex with its primary regulator, RsbW. sigma B becomes available to RNA polymerase when RsbW forms a complex with an additional regulatory protein (RsbV) and, because of this, fails to bind sigma B. Using Western blot (immunoblot) analyses, reporter gene fusion assays, and measurements of nucleotide pool sizes, we provide evidence for two independent processes that promote the binding of RsbW to RsbV. The first occurs during carbon limitation or entry into stationary phase. Activation of sigma B under these circumstances correlates with a drop in the intracellular levels of ATP and may be a direct consequence of ATP levels on RsbW's binding preference. The second activation process relies on the product of a third regulatory gene, rsbU. RsbU is dispensable for sigma B activation during carbon limitation or stationary phase but is needed for activation of sigma B in response to any of a number of different environmental insults (ethanol treatment, salt or acid shock, etc.). RsbU, or a process dependent on it, alters RsbW binding without regard for intracellular levels of ATP. In at least some instances, the effects of multiple inducing stimuli are additive. The data are consistent with RsbW being a regulator at which distinct signals from separate effectors can be integrated to modulate sigma B activity.},

The signal that triggers the nutritional stress phosphatase (RsbP) is unknown; however, RsbP activation occurs under culture conditions (glucose/phosphate starvation, azide or decoyinine treatment) that reduce the cell's levels of ATP and/or GTP. Variances in nucleotide levels in these instances may be coincidental rather than causal. RsbP carries a domain (PAS) that in some regulatory systems can respond directly to changes in electron transport, proton motive force, or redox potential, changes that typically precede shifts in high-energy nucleotide levels. The current work uses Bacillus subtilis with mutations in the oxidative phosphorylation and purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathways in conjunction with metabolic inhibitors to better define the inducing signal for RsbP activation. The data argue that a drop in ATP, rather than changes in GTP, proton motive force, or redox state, is the key to triggering sigma(B) activation.},

Bacillus subtilis imports a large set of osmostress protectants via five osmotically controlled transport systems (OpuA to OpuE). Biosynthesis of the particularly effective osmoprotectant glycine betaine requires the exogenous supply of choline. While OpuB is rather specific for choline, OpuC imports a broad spectrum of compatible solutes, including choline and glycine betaine. One previously mapped antisense RNA of B. subtilis, S1290, exhibits strong and transient expression in response to a suddenly imposed salt stress. It covers the coding region of the opuB operon and is expressed from a strictly SigB-dependent promoter. By inactivation of this promoter and analysis of opuB and opuC transcript levels, we discovered a time-delayed osmotic induction of opuB that crucially depends on the S1290 antisense RNA and on the degree of the imposed osmotic stress. Time-delayed osmotic induction of opuB is apparently caused by transcriptional interference of RNA-polymerase complexes driving synthesis of the converging opuB and S1290 mRNAs. When our data are viewed in an ecophysiological framework, it appears that during the early adjustment phase of B. subtilis to acute osmotic stress, the cell prefers to initially rely on the transport activity of the promiscuous OpuC system and only subsequently fully induces opuB. Our data also reveal an integration of osmostress-specific adjustment systems with the SigB-controlled general stress response at a deeper level than previously appreciated.},

Mn(II) leads to the MntR-dependent repression of both the mntH and mntABCD operons encoding Mn(II) uptake systems. Mn(II) also represses the Fur regulon. This repression is unlikely to be a direct effect of Mn(II) on Fur as repression is sensitive to 2,2′-dipyridyl, an iron-selective chelator. We suggest that elevated Mn(II) displaces iron from cellular-binding sites and the resulting rise in free iron levels leads to repression of the Fur regulon. Many of the genes induced by Mn(II) are activated by σB or TnrA. Both of these regulators are controlled by Mn(II)-dependent enzymes. Induction of the σB-dependent general stress response by Mn(II) is largely dependent on RsbU, a Mn(II)-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates RsbV, ultimately leading to release of active σB from its antisigma, RsbW. The activity of TnrA is inhibited when it forms an inactive complex with feedback-inhibited glutamine synthetase. Elevated Mn(II) reduces the sensitivity of glutamine synthetase to feedback inhibitors, and we suggest that this leads to the observed increase in TnrA activity. In sum, three distinct mechanisms can account for most of the transcriptional effects elicited by manganese: (i) direct binding of Mn(II) to metalloregulators such as MntR, (ii) perturbation of cellular iron pools leading to increased Fur activity and (iii) altered activity of Mn(II)-dependent enzymes that regulate the activity of σB and TnrA.},

We report the response of Bacillus subtilis to bacitracin, an inhibitor of cell wall biosynthesis found in its natural environment. Analysis of the global transcriptional profile of bacitracin-treated cells reveals a response orchestrated by two alternative sigma factors (sigmaB and sigmaM) and three two-component systems (YvqEC, YvcPQ and BceRS). All three two-component systems are located next to target genes that are strongly induced by bacitracin, and the corresponding histidine kinases share an unusual topology: they lack about 100 amino acids in their extracellular sensing domain, which is almost entirely buried in the cytoplasmic membrane. Sequence analysis indicates that this novel N-terminal sensing domain is a characteristic feature of a subfamily of histidine kinases, found almost entirely in Gram-positive bacteria and frequently linked to ABC transporters. A systematic mutational analysis of bacitracin-induced genes led to the identification of a new bacitracin-resistance determinant, bceAB, encoding a putative ABC transporter. The bcrC bacitracin resistance gene, which is under the dual control of sigmaX and sigmaM, was also induced by bacitracin. By comparing the bacitracin and the vancomycin stimulons, we can differentiate between loci induced specifically by bacitracin and those that are induced by multiple cell wall-active antibiotics.},

            The ability to monitor the environment for toxic chemical and physical disturbances is essential for bacteria that live in dynamic environments. The fundamental sensing mechanisms and physiological responses that allow bacteria to thrive are conserved even if the molecular components of these pathways are not. The bacterial general stress response (GSR) represents a conceptual model for how one pathway integrates a wide range of environmental signals, and how a generalized system with broad molecular responses is coordinated to promote survival likely through complementary pathways. Environmental stress signals such as heat, osmotic stress, and pH changes are received by sensor proteins that through a signaling cascade activate the sigma factor, SigB, to regulate over 200 genes. Additionally, the GSR plays an important role in stress priming that increases bacterial fitness to unrelated subsequent stressors such as oxidative compounds. While the GSR response is implicated during oxidative stress, the reason for its activation remains unknown and suggests crosstalk between environmental and oxidative stress sensors and responses to coordinate antioxidant functions. Systems levels studies of cellular responses such as transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of stressed bacteria and single-cell analysis could shed light into the regulated functions that protect, remediate, and minimize damage during dynamic environments. This perspective will focus on fundamental stress sensing mechanisms and responses in Gram-positive bacterial species to illustrate their commonalities at the molecular and physiological levels; summarize exciting directions; and highlight how system-level approaches can help us understand bacterial physiology.},

Bacterial species respond to oxidative stress by activating transcriptional profiles that include biochemical functions to reduce oxidized cellular components, regenerate pools of reducing molecules, and detoxify harmful metabolites. Interestingly, the general stress response in Gram positive bacteria controlled by SigB is induced by oxidative stress from reactive oxygen and electrophilic species. The upregulation of SigB regulated genes during exposure to electrophilic and oxidative compounds suggests SigB contributes directly to the adaptations required for oxidative stress survival. A subset of the functions of SigB regulated genes can be categorized with antioxidant biochemical activities, such as redoxins, reductases and dehydrogenases, including regulation of low molecular weight thiols, yet their exact cellular role is not fully understood. Here, we present an overview of the predicted antioxidant biochemical functions regulated by SigB, with potential for biomedical research given the prevalence of oxidative stress during bacterial infection, as well as during industrial applications of large-scale production of compounds by microbes.},

Here, we find that non-sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells can survive deep starvation conditions for many months. During this period, cells adopt an almost coccoid shape and become tolerant to antibiotics. Unexpectedly, these cells appear to be metabolically active and show a transcriptome profile very different from that of stationary phase cells. We show that these starved cells are not dormant but are growing and dividing, albeit with a doubling time close to 4 days. Very low nutrient levels, comparable to 10,000-fold diluted lysogeny broth (LB), are sufficient to sustain this growth. This extreme slow growth, which we propose to call ‘oligotrophic growth state’, provides an alternative strategy for B. subtilis to endure nutrient depletion and environmental stresses. Further work is warranted to test whether this state can be found in other bacterial species to survive deep starvation conditions., Bacteria can become dormant or form spores when starved for nutrients.

The 2D gels only depict single moments during the cells' growth cycle, but a sequential series of overlays obtained at specific points of the growth curve facilitates visualization of the developmental processes at the proteomics scale. During glucose starvation a substantial reprogramming of the protein synthesis pattern was found, with 150 proteins synthesized de novo and cessation of the synthesis of almost 400 proteins. Proteins induced following glucose starvation belong to two main regulation groups: general stress/starvation responses induced by different stresses or starvation stimuli (ςB-dependent general stress regulon, stringent response, sporulation), and glucose-starvation-specific responses (drop in glycolysis, utilization of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis). Using the dual channel approach, it was not only possible to identify those regulons or stimulons, but also to follow the fate of each single protein by the three-color code: red, newly induced but not yet accumulated; yellow, synthesized and accumulated; and green, still present, but no longer being synthesized. These green proteins, which represent a substantial part of the protein pool in the nongrowing cell, are not accessible by using DNA arrays. The combination of 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry with the dual channel imaging technique provides a new and comprehensive view of the physiology of growing or starving bacterial cell populations, here for the case of the glucose-starvation response., [This is presented as a movie of B. subtilis's growth/glucose-starvation response, available at www.genome.org and also at http://microbio1.biologie.uni-greifswald.de/starv/movie.htm.]},

This 135 kb viral genome is integrated into the circular DNA chromosome of B. subtilis, and contains genes for the production of and resistance to sublancin. We investigated the role of SigY in sublancin production and resistance, finding that it is important for efficient maintenance of the Spβ prophage. We were unable to detect the prophage in mutants lacking SigY. Additionally, these mutants were no longer able to produce sublancin, were sensitive to killing by this factor, and displayed a delay in sporulation. Wild-type cells with normal SigY activity were found to partially lose the Spβ prophage during growth and early sporulation, suggesting a mechanism for the bistable outcome of sibling cells capable of killing and of being killed. The appropriate regulation of SigY appears to be essential for growth as evidenced by the inability to disrupt the gene for its putative antisigma. Our results confirm a role for SigY in antibiotic production and resistance, as has been found for other members of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor family in B. subtilis, and shows that this role is achieved by affecting maintenance of the Spβ prophage.},

Here we identify a prominent role for sigma(W), an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor, in providing intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial compounds produced by other Bacilli. By using a panel of B. subtilis mutants disrupted for each of the 30 known sigma(W)-dependent operons we identified resistance genes for at least three different antimicrobial compounds. The ydbST and fosB genes contribute to resistance to antimicrobial compound(s) produced by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, the yqeZyqfAB operon provides resistance to the SPbeta prophage-encoded bacteriocin sublancin, and the yknWXYZ operon and yfhL provide resistance to the antimicrobial peptide SdpC. YfhL encodes a paralogue of SdpI, a membrane protein that provides immunity to SdpC. In competition experiments, we identify sigma(W) as a key factor in allowing B. subtilis to resist antibiotic killing and encroachment by competing strains. Together with the previous observation that sigma(W) provides inducible resistance against the Streptomyces antibiotic fosfomycin, these studies support the notion that sigma(W) controls an antibiosis regulon important in the microbial ecology of soil bacteria.},

This combined experimental approach provided quantitative data for 3,961 mRNA transcription profiles, 590 expression profiles of proteins detected in the cytosol, and 383 expression profiles of proteins detected in the membrane fraction. Our study uncovered a well-coordinated induction of gene expression subsequent to an osmotic upshift that involves large parts of the SigB, SigW, SigM, and SigX regulons. Additionally osmotic upregulation of a large number of genes that do not belong to these regulons was observed. In total, osmotic upregulation of about 500 B. subtilis genes was detected.

	abstract = {The seven extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma (σ) factors of Bacillus subtilis are broadly implicated in resistance to antibiotics and other cell envelope stressors mediated, in part, by regulation of cell envelope synthesis and modification enzymes. We here define the regulon of σ(V) as including at least 20 operons, many of which are also regulated by σ(M), σ(X), or σ(W). The σ(V) regulon is strongly and specifically induced by lysozyme, and this induction is key to the intrinsic resistance of B. subtilis to lysozyme. Strains with null mutations in either sigV or all seven ECF σ factor genes (Δ7ECF) have essentially equal increases in sensitivity to lysozyme. Induction of σ(V) in the Δ7ECF background restores lysozyme resistance, whereas induction of σ(M), σ(X), or σ(W) does not. Lysozyme resistance results from the ability of σ(V) to activate the transcription of two operons: the autoregulated sigV-rsiV-oatA-yrhK operon and dltABCDE. Genetic analyses reveal that oatA and dlt are largely redundant with respect to lysozyme sensitivity: single mutants are not affected in lysozyme sensitivity, whereas an oatA dltA double mutant is as sensitive as a sigV null strain. Moreover, the sigV oatA dltA triple mutant is no more sensitive than the oatA dltA double mutant, indicating that there are no other σ(V)-dependent genes necessary for lysozyme resistance. Thus, we suggest that σ(V) confers lysozyme resistance by the activation of two cell wall modification pathways: O-acetylation of peptidoglycan catalyzed by OatA and D-alanylation of teichoic acids by DltABCDE.},

	abstract = {To alleviate the harmful effects of antibiotics on the environment and human health, the stress response and molecular network of Bacillus under tetracycline stress were investigated using a proteomics approach. During the exposure process, Bacillus subtilis exhibited a strong adaptation mechanism. Cell membrane and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level returned to normal after 5 h. A total of 312 upregulated and 65 downregulated proteins were identified, mainly involved in metabolism and the synthesis of ribosomes, DNA, and RNA. After tetracycline exposure, the core metabolism network was accelerated to supply precursors for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, peptidoglycans, and saturated fatty acids that were involved in ribosome protection, and strengthened the cell wall and cell membrane. The signal transduction pathways involved were analyzed in association with the stress response of B. subtilis at 15 min of exposure to tetracycline. The primary damage to the ribosome by tetracycline activated a series of response proteins. Antitoxin and heat-shock proteins were activated for the global regulation of transcription and metabolism. Trigger factor Tig was upregulated to ensure proper initiation of transcription and aerobic respiration. Temperature-sensor protein VicR from the two-component system was used by the cell to regulate the composition of the cell wall and cell membrane. The over-consumption of metabolites, such as phosphoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP), purine nucleoside triphosphate (GTP), and acetyl-CoA forced the cells to assimilate more sugar for glycolysis. To this end, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and sugar transportation protein PtsG were upregulated, simultaneously. Ultimately, peroxidase was activated to eliminate the redundant ROS, to minimize cell damage. These findings presented a system-level understanding of adaption processes of bacteria to antibiotic stress.},

	abstract = {The endospore-forming bacteria have persisted on earth perhaps 3Ga, leveraging the flexibility of their distinctive lifestyle to adapt to a remarkably wide range of environments. This process of adaptation can be investigated through the simple but powerful technique of laboratory evolution. Evolved strains can be analyzed by whole genome sequencing and an array of omics technologies. The intensively studied, genetically tractable endospore-former, Bacillus subtilis, is an ideal subject for laboratory evolution experiments. Here, we describe the use of the B. subtilis model system to study the adaptation of these bacteria to reduced and stringent selection for endospore formation, as well as to novel environmental challenges of low atmospheric pressure, high ultraviolet radiation, and unfavourable growth temperatures. In combination with other approaches, including comparative genomics and environmental field work, laboratory evolution may help elucidate how these bacteria have so successfully adapted to life on earth, and perhaps beyond.},

Populations that evolved under UV stress were about 3-fold more resistant than the ancestral and non-UV-evolved populations. UV-evolved cells were 7-fold more resistant to ionizing radiation than their non-UV-exposed evolved relatives and ancestor. In addition to the acquired increased UV resistance, further changes in microbial stress response to hydrogen peroxide, increased salinity, and desiccation were observed in UV-evolved cells. This indicates that UV-sensitive ancestral cells are capable of adapting to periodically applied UV stress via the evolution of cells with an increased UV resistance level and further enhanced responses to other environmental stressors, which thereby allows them to survive and reproduce under extreme UV radiation as a selection pressure.

As reviewed in this article, B. cereus adapts to acidic pH and changing oxygen conditions through diverse regulatory mechanisms and then exploits its metabolic flexibility to grow and produce enterotoxins. We then focus on the intricate link between metabolism, redox homeostasis, and enterotoxins, which are recognized as important contributors of food-borne disease.},

Only nine cases of Bacillus licheniformis infection have been reported in the English-language literature since 1966.

All six patients had either a Hickman or a Broviac catheter in place for more than 3 months. Five of the six patients had multiple clinically significant episodes of bacteremia due to B. licheniformis. The six patients ranged in age from 4 years to 62 years. Two patients had leukemia or lymphoma and three patients had solid tumors, but only one patient was neutropenic. No deaths were related to B. licheniformis bacteremia. B. licheniformis should be considered as a potential pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially when bacteremia is associated with the presence of long-term central venous catheters.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacillus licheniformis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming soil bacterium that is used in the biotechnology industry to manufacture enzymes, antibiotics, biochemicals and consumer products. This species is closely related to the well studied model organism Bacillus subtilis, and produces an assortment of extracellular enzymes that may contribute to nutrient cycling in nature.
RESULTS: We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 genome which comprises a circular chromosome of 4,222,336 base-pairs (bp) containing 4,208 predicted protein-coding genes with an average size of 873 bp, seven rRNA operons, and 72 tRNA genes. The B. licheniformis chromosome contains large regions that are colinear with the genomes of B. subtilis and Bacillus halodurans, and approximately 80\% of the predicted B. licheniformis coding sequences have B. subtilis orthologs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the unmistakable organizational similarities between the B. licheniformis and B. subtilis genomes, there are notable differences in the numbers and locations of prophages, transposable elements and a number of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolic pathway operons that distinguish these species. Differences include a region of more than 80 kilobases (kb) that comprises a cluster of polyketide synthase genes and a second operon of 38 kb encoding plipastatin synthase enzymes that are absent in the B. licheniformis genome. The availability of a completed genome sequence for B. licheniformis should facilitate the design and construction of improved industrial strains and allow for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies within this group of Bacillaceae.},

Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, these strains belonged to the Bacillus cereus group, sharing over 97 \% similarity with the known species of this group, and less than 95 \% similarity with other species of the genus Bacillus. Multilocus sequence typing analysis showed that they formed nine robust and well-separated branches from the known species. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between the nine strains were, respectively, below the 70 and 96 \% threshold values for species definition, and between each strain and the known type strains of this group were also below the two threshold values. On the basis of the phenotypic and phylogenetic data, along with low dDDH and ANI values among these strains, these bacteria are assigned to the following nine novel species of the B. cereus group: Bacillus paranthracis sp. nov., type strain Mn5T (=MCCC 1A00395T=KCTC 33714T=LMG 28873T); Bacillus pacificus sp. nov., type strain EB422T (=MCCC 1A06182T=KCTC 33858T); Bacillus tropicus sp. nov., type strain N24T (=MCCC 1A01406T=KCTC 33711T=LMG 28874T); Bacillus albus sp. nov., type strain N35-10-2T (=MCCC 1A02146T=KCTC 33710T=LMG 28875T); Bacillus mobilis sp. nov., type strain 0711P9-1T (=MCCC 1A05942T=KCTC 33717T=LMG 28877T); Bacillus luti sp. nov., type strain TD41T (=MCCC 1A00359T=KCTC 33716T=LMG 28872T); Bacillus proteolyticus sp. nov., type strain TD42T (=MCCC 1A00365T=KCTC 33715T=LMG 28870T); Bacillus nitratireducens sp. nov., type strain 4049T (=MCCC 1A00732T=KCTC 33713T=LMG 28871T); and Bacillus paramycoides sp. nov., type strain NH24A2T (=MCCC 1A04098T=KCTC 33709T=LMG 28876T).},

Meanwhile, the metabolic, physiological and chemotaxonomic features for the type strain of B. weihenstephanensis were shown to be congruent with those of B. mycoides. On this basis, the taxonomic affiliations of related strains from the Genbank database were determined using multilocus sequence typing and genomic analyses.

	abstract = {Bacillus cereus is widespread in nature and frequently isolated from soil and growing plants, but it is also well adapted for growth in the intestinal tract of insects and mammals. From these habitats it is easily spread to foods, where it may cause an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of food-associated illness that is becoming increasingly important in the industrialized world. The emetic disease is a food intoxication caused by cereulide, a small ring-formed dodecadepsipeptide. Similar to the virulence determinants that distinguish Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus anthracis from B. cereus, the genetic determinants of cereulide are plasmid-borne. The diarrhoeal syndrome of B. cereus is an infection caused by vegetative cells, ingested as viable cells or spores, thought to produce protein enterotoxins in the small intestine. Three pore-forming cytotoxins have been associated with diarrhoeal disease: haemolysin BL (Hbl), nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and cytotoxin K. Hbl and Nhe are homologous three-component toxins, which appear to be related to the monooligomeric toxin cytolysin A found in Escherichia coli. This review will focus on the toxins associated with foodborne diseases frequently caused by B. cereus. The disease characteristics are described, and recent findings regarding the associated toxins are discussed, as well as the present knowledge on virulence regulation.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: A biotinylated bcr1 element was immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used to pull out a 20 kDa DNA-binding protein from a whole cell protein extract of B. cereus ATCC 14579. The protein was identified as the product of ORF 2 encoded by the bacteriophage-related autonomously replicating linear genetic element pBClin15 carried by the strain. DNA binding was not bcr1-specific. By Northern blotting ORF 2 was co-transcribed with ORF 1, and also in certain instances with ORF 3 by transcriptional readthrough of the terminator located between ORF 2 and ORF 3.
CONCLUSIONS: ORF 2 from pBClin15 encodes a DNA-binding protein. ORF 2 is co-transcribed with its upstream gene ORF 1, and in a subset of the transcripts also with the downstream gene ORF 3 through alternative transcription termination.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The B. cereus group contains bacterial species of medical and economic importance. Bacteriophages or phage-encoded proteins from these bacteria have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents. Understanding the biology of bacteriophage-related genetic elements through functional characterization of their genes is of high relevance.},

The reference strain, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, harbors a linear plasmid, pBClin15, which displays a cryptic prophage behavior. Here, we studied the impact of pBClin15 on the aerobic respiratory metabolism of B. cereus by curing its host strain. We compared, by means of a high-throughput shotgun proteomic approach, both the cellular proteome and the exoproteome of B. cereus ATCC 14579 in the presence and absence of pBClin15 at the early, late and stationary growth phases. The results were visualized through a hierarchical cluster analysis of proteomic data. We found that pBClin15 contributes significantly to the metabolic efficiency of B. cereus by restricting the production of chromosome-encoded phage proteins in the extracellular milieu. The data also revealed intricate regulatory mechanisms between pBClin15 and its host. Finally, we show that pBClin15 provides benefit to its host to adapt to different ecologic niches.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Bacteria belonging to the Bacillus cereus group include B. cereus, a notorious food borne pathogen which causes gastroenteritis. The B. cereus type, strain ATCC 14579, harbors a linear plasmid, pBClin15, which displays cryptic prophage behavior. Here, we present data supporting the idea that pBClin15 may have a much greater role in B. cereus metabolism that has hitherto been suspected. Specifically, our comparative proteomic analyses reveal that pBClin15 manages B. cereus central metabolism to optimize energy and carbon utilization through the repression of several chromosome-encoded phage proteins. These results suggest that pBClin15 provides benefit to the host for surviving adverse environmental conditions.},

It is closely related to the animal and human pathogen Bacillus anthracis and the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis, the former being used as a biological weapon and the latter as a pesticide. B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis are readily distinguished from B. cereus by the presence of plasmid-borne specific toxins (B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis) and capsule (B. anthracis). But phylogenetic studies based on the analysis of chromosomal genes bring controversial results, and it is unclear whether B. cereus, B. anthracis and B. thuringiensis are varieties of the same species2 or different species3,4. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the type strain B. cereus ATCC 14579. The complete genome sequence of B. cereus ATCC 14579 together with the gapped genome of B. anthracis A20125 enables us to perform comparative analysis, and hence to identify the genes that are conserved between B. cereus and B. anthracis, and the genes that are unique for each species.

	abstract = {Due to its clear inherited backgrounds as well as simple and diverse genetic manipulation systems, Bacillus subtilis is the key Gram-positive model bacterium for studies on physiology and metabolism. Furthermore, due to its highly efficient protein secretion system and adaptable metabolism, it has been widely used as a cell factory for microbial production of chemicals, enzymes, and antimicrobial materials for industry, agriculture, and medicine. In this mini-review, we first summarize the basic genetic manipulation tools and expression systems for this bacterium, including traditional methods and novel engineering systems. Secondly, we briefly introduce its applications in the production of chemicals and enzymes, and summarize its advantages, mainly focusing on some noteworthy products and recent progress in the engineering of B. subtilis. Finally, this review also covers applications such as microbial additives and antimicrobials, as well as biofilm systems and spore formation. We hope to provide an overview for novice researchers in this area, offering them a better understanding of B. subtilis and its applications.},

Due to the broad knowledge and annotation and the well-developed genetic system, this bacterium is an excellent starting point for genome minimization with the aim of constructing a minimal cell. We have analyzed the genome of B. subtilis and selected all genes that are required to allow life in complex medium at 37°C. This selection is based on the known information on essential genes and functions as well as on gene and protein expression data and gene conservation. The list presented here includes 523 and 119 genes coding for proteins and RNAs, respectively. These proteins and RNAs are required for the basic functions of life in information processing (replication and chromosome maintenance, transcription, translation, protein folding, and secretion), metabolism, cell division, and the integrity of the minimal cell. The completeness of the selected metabolic pathways, reactions, and enzymes was verified by the development of a model of metabolism of the minimal cell. A comparison of the MiniBacillus genome to the recently reported designed minimal genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn3.0 indicates excellent agreement in the information-processing pathways, whereas each species has a metabolism that reflects specific evolution and adaptation.

The immense number of living organisms precludes experimental identification of functions except in a handful of model organisms. The bacterial domain is split into large branches, among which the Firmicutes occupy a considerable space. Bacillus subtilis has been the model of Firmicutes for decades and its genome has been a reference for more than 10 years. Sequencing the genome involved more than 30 laboratories, with different expertises, in a attempt to make the most of the experimental information that could be associated with the sequence. This had the expected drawback that the sequencing expertise was quite varied among the groups involved, especially at a time when sequencing genomes was extremely hard work. The recent development of very efficient, fast and accurate sequencing techniques, in parallel with the development of high-level annotation platforms, motivated the present resequencing work. The updated sequence has been reannotated in agreement with the UniProt protein knowledge base, keeping in perspective the split between the paleome (genes necessary for sustaining and perpetuating life) and the cenome (genes required for occupation of a niche, suggesting here that B. subtilis is an epiphyte). This should permit investigators to make reliable inferences to prepare validation experiments in a variety of domains of bacterial growth and development as well as build up accurate phylogenies.},

Using a combination of inductive, deductive and abductive reasoning, we present a unique, manually curated annotation, essentially based on experimental data. This reveals how this bacterium lives in a plant niche, while carrying a paleome operating system common to Firmicutes and Tenericutes. Dozens of new genomic objects and an extensive literature survey have been included for the sequence available at the INSDC (AccNum AL009126.3).

Aspects of cell morphology and physiology, and genome sequence similarity and gene synteny support close evolutionary relationships for these three species. For many strains, distinct differences in virulence factor synthesis provide facile means for species assignment. B. anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax. Some B. cereus strains are commonly recognized as food poisoning agents, but strains can also cause localized wound and eye infections as well as systemic disease. Certain B. thuringiensis strains are entomopathogens and have been commercialized for use as biopesticides, while some strains have been reported to cause infection in immunocompromised individuals. In this chapter we compare and contrast B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis, including ecology, cell structure and development, virulence attributes, gene regulation and genetic exchange systems, and experimental models of disease.},

	abstract = {The identification and phylogenetic relationships of bacteria within the Bacillus cereus group are controversial. This study aimed at determining the taxonomic affiliations of these strains using the whole-genome sequence-based Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) approach. The GBDP analysis clearly separated 224 strains into 30 clusters, representing eleven known, partially merged species and accordingly 19-20 putative novel species. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene analysis, a novel variant of multi-locus sequence analysis (nMLSA) and screening of virulence genes were performed. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was not sufficient to differentiate the bacteria within this group due to its high conservation. The nMLSA results were consistent with GBDP. Moreover, a fast typing method was proposed using the pycA gene, and where necessary, the ccpA gene. The pXO plasmids and cry genes were widely distributed, suggesting little correlation with the phylogenetic positions of the host bacteria. This might explain why classifications based on virulence characteristics proved unsatisfactory in the past. In summary, this is the first large-scale and systematic study of the taxonomic status of the bacteria within the B. cereus group using whole-genome sequences, and is likely to contribute to further insights into their pathogenicity, phylogeny and adaptation to diverse environments.},

Prior to 1980, the year of the compilation of the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names, four genera of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria had been established, with the genus Bacillus being the largest and most prominent. However, modern developments in taxonomic methodology have helped to reveal an enormous breadth in physiological and genetical diversity within the groups of aerobic bacteria that have endospore formation as a common trait. To better reflect this existing diversity and to provide more appropriate taxonomic arrangements, numerous valid descriptions of new genera and new species have been realized as well as many reclassifications that became necessary. Today, the group of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria embraces more than 25 genera and over 200 species.},

The colloquial, diaristic style conceals the workings of a startlingly original experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of less than 1 µm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms, interactions and behaviour of his little ‘animalcules', which inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules, where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far from resolved—these questions still challenge our understanding of microbial evolution.

Thus, the total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60–100\% of the estimated total carbon in plants, and inclusion of prokaryotic carbon in global models will almost double estimates of the amount of carbon stored in living organisms. In addition, the earth’s prokaryotes contain 85–130 Pg of N and 9–14 Pg of P, or about 10-fold more of these nutrients than do plants, and represent the largest pool of these nutrients in living organisms. Most of the earth’s prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 × 1029, 2.6 × 1029, 3.5 × 1030, and 0.25–2.5 × 1030, respectively. The numbers of heterotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6–25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1–2 × 103 yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 × 1030 cells/yr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {Biofilms are a form of collective life with emergent properties that confer many advantages on their inhabitants, and they represent a much higher level of organization than single cells do. However, to date, no global analysis on biofilm abundance exists. We offer a critical discussion of the definition of biofilms and compile current estimates of global cell numbers in major microbial habitats, mindful of the associated uncertainty. Most bacteria and archaea on Earth (1.2 × 1030 cells) exist in the ‘big five’ habitats: deep oceanic subsurface (4 × 1029), upper oceanic sediment (5 × 1028), deep continental subsurface (3 × 1029), soil (3 × 1029) and oceans (1 × 1029). The remaining habitats, including groundwater, the atmosphere, the ocean surface microlayer, humans, animals and the phyllosphere, account for fewer cells by orders of magnitude. Biofilms dominate in all habitats on the surface of the Earth, except in the oceans, accounting for {\textasciitilde}80\% of bacterial and archaeal cells. In the deep subsurface, however, they cannot always be distinguished from single sessile cells; we estimate that 20–80\% of cells in the subsurface exist as biofilms. Hence, overall, 40–80\% of cells on Earth reside in biofilms. We conclude that biofilms drive all biogeochemical processes and represent the main way of active bacterial and archaeal life.},

	abstract = {Strain BAS50, isolated from a petroleum reservoir at a depth of 1,500 m and identified as Bacillus licheniformis, grew and produced a lipopeptide surfactant when cultured on a variety of substrates at salinities of up to 13\% NaCl. Surfactant production occurred both aerobically and anaerobically and was optimal at 5\% NaCl and temperatures between 35 and 45 degrees C. The biosurfactant, termed lichenysin A, was purified and chemically characterized. A tentative structure and composition for the surfactant are described. Lichenysin A is a mixture of lipopeptides, with the major components ranging in size from 1,006 to 1,034 Da. The lipid moiety contains a mixture of 14 linear and branched beta-hydroxy fatty acids ranging in size from C12 to C17. There are seven amino acids per molecule. The peptide moiety is composed of the following amino acids: glutamic acid as the N-terminal amino acid, asparagine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine as the C-terminal amino acid, at a ratio of 1.1:1.1:1.0:2.8:1.0, respectively. Purified lichenysin A decreases the surface tension of water from 72 mN/m to 28 mN/m and achieves the critical micelle concentration with as little as 12 mg/liter, characterizing the product as a powerful surface-active agent that compares favorably to others surfactants. The antibacterial activity of lichenysin A has been demonstrated.},

However, non-thermal technologies in food processing do not generate high temperature and use short treatment times. This means that the nutritional components of foodstuffs are better retained, and the sensory properties of foods are less changed compared with traditional thermal processing. The aim of this review was to present non-thermal technologies applications and its mechanism in food industry in recently, and to explore the potential application prospects of combining non-thermal treatments applied in food industry because it not only could overcomes the drawback of single technology, but also can enhances the processing efficiency at lower treatment intensity.},

	abstract = {Increasing consumer demand for high-quality foods has driven adoption by the food industry of non-thermal technologies such as high pressure processing (HPP). The technology is employed as a post-packaging treatment step for inactivation of vegetative microorganisms. In order to evaluate HPP inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes in acid and acidified juices and beverages, pressure tolerance parameters were determined using log-linear and Weibull models in pH-adjusted apple juice (pH 4.5) at 5 °C. A commercial processing HPP unit was used. The Weibull model better described the inactivation kinetics of the three tested pathogens. According to estimates from the Weibull model, 1.5, 0.9, and 1.5 min are required at 600 MPa to produce 5-log reductions of E. coli, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes, respectively, whereas according to the log-linear model, 3.2, 1.8, and 2.1 min are required. The effects of process conditions were verified using commercial products (pH between 3.02 and 4.21). In all tested commercial juices or beverages, greater than 5-log reductions were achieved for all tested pathogens using HPP process conditions of 550 MPa for 1 min. These findings demonstrate that the HPP conditions of 600 MPa for 3 min, typically used by the food industry provide an adequate safety margin for control of relevant vegetative pathogens in acid and acidified juices and beverages (pH {\textless} 4.5). Results from this study can be used by food processors to support validation studies and may be useful for the future establishment of safe harbors for the HPP industry.},

In this study, the effect of lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus subtilis on the interfacial tension (IFT) and wettability in oil–brine–mineral systems was quantitatively examined by monitoring dodecane–brine IFT and the contact angle of a dodecane–brine–quartz system during cultivation of B. subtilis. The effect of high temperature (35–45 °C) and pressure (∼10 MPa), emulating conditions of in situ reservoir environments, on the effectiveness of the biosurfactant producers was also assessed using a custom-designed high-pressure bioreactor. Within the examined temperature range, it was confirmed that B. subtilis produced the lipopeptide biosurfactant (surfactin) with and without oxygen using nitrate (NO3–) as the alternative electron acceptor. Thereby, the IFT was reduced from ∼50 to ∼10 mN/m and the wettability was modified from the values indicating an intermediate water-wet condition (θ = ∼45–50°) to a strong water-wet condition (θ = ∼20–25°). With the significantly improved capillary factor (γ cos θ) by a factor of 4.4, the two-phase flow simulations using the pore network model estimated significant increases in oil recovery rates in microbially treated reservoirs. The lowest rate and amount of surfactin production were observed at 45 °C, suggesting that higher temperatures may not be favorable for surfactin production by Bacillus spp. These results provide unique quantitative experimental evidence corroborating the feasibility of utilizing biosurfactant-producing microorganisms for MEOR practices targeting reservoirs with high pressure and moderately high temperature.},

Structural hallmarks of this class of compounds are the occurrence of unusual amino acids, mostly cyclic peptide backbones, and numerous further modifications such as acylation, heterocyclic ring formation, and glycosylation. Because of their structural complexity, chemical synthesis is usually an unattractive route to these molecules. In contrast, genetic engineering of the biosynthesis genes emerges as a potentially powerful approach to the combinatorial biosynthesis of useful analogues of the lead compounds. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) carry out a sequential multistep assembly and modification of the peptides in a thiotemplate process described by the multiple carrier model. The modular architecture of NRPSs suggests straightforward methods for the reprogramming of these enzymes by exchange of catalytic subunits. However, many of the reported engineering attempts faced low product yields or even inactive hybrid enzymes. Using a new approach to obtain hybrid NRPSs, we show here that the deletion of an entire module in an NRPS assembly line caused the secretion of the predicted peptide antibiotic variant with a decreased ring size. Furthermore, a module exchange resulted in a significantly higher product yield than that observed in previous studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacillus subtilis strain PB2-L1 produces the lipopeptide surfactin, a highly potent biosurfactant synthesized by a large multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In the present study, the modules SrfA-A-Leu, SrfA-B-Asp, and SrfA-B-Leu from surfactin NRPS in B. subtilis BP2-L1 were successfully knocked-out using a temperature-sensitive plasmid, pKS2-mediated-based, homologous, recombination method.
RESULTS: Three novel surfactin products were produced, individually lacking amino acid Leu-3, Asp-5, or Leu-6. These surfactins were detected, isolated, and characterized by HPLC and LC-FTICR-MS/MS. In comparison with native surfactin, [∆Leu(3)]surfactin and [∆Leu(6)]surfactin showed evidence of reduced toxicity, while [∆Asp(5)]surfactin showed stronger inhibition than native surfactin against B. pumilus and Micrococcus luteus. These results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration of [∆Leu(6)]surfactin for Fusarium moniliforme was 50 μg/mL, such that [∆Leu(6)]surfactin could lead to mycelium projection, cell damage, and leakage of nucleic acids and protein. These factors all contributed to stimulating apoptosis in F. moniliforme.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results revealed that [∆Leu(6)]surfactin showed a significant antifungal activity against F. moniliforme and might successfully be employed to control fungal food contamination and improve food safety.},

However, there is little knowledge about the relationship between apoptosis induction and membrane fatty acids. The present study focused on the effects of lipopeptides produced by Bacillus subtilis HSO121 on Bcap-37 cell lines. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl (MTT) colorimetric assay and surface tension measurements, showed that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) was a critical level for the inhibitory activity of lipopeptides on the growth of Bcap-37 cells. Under the CMC, the order of least to greatest cytotoxicity effect on cancer cell lines by lipopeptides is C(13)-lipopeptide {\textless} C(14)-lipopepitde {\textless} C(15)-lipopeptide. Above CMC, all lipopeptides directly exert cytolytic activity. The flow cytometric analysis and Hoechst33258 staining experiments confirmed the apoptosis of Bcap-37 cell lines induced by lipopeptides in a dose-dependent manner. This apoptosis was associated with a significant decrease of the unsaturated degree of the cellular fatty acids of Bcap-37 cell lines due to the changes in the cellular fatty acids composition induced by the lipopeptide treatment. These results indicated that disturbance of the cellular fatty acid composition of breast cancer cell lines were related to in the cell apoptosis. Furthermore, significant difference in IC(50) values of tumor cells and normal cell showed that the lipopeptide exerted selective cytotoxicity on the cancer cells.

Bacillus and Geobacillus represented the most commonly isolated spore genera (approximately 68.9 and 12.1\%, respectively, of all spore isolates). Whereas Bacillus licheniformis was isolated from samples collected from all plants and farms, Geobacillus spp. were isolated from samples from 3 out of 4 plants and just 1 out of 33 farms. We found significant differences between the spore population isolated from bulk tank raw milk and those isolated from dairy powder plant samples, except samples from the plant producing acid whey. A comparison of spore species isolated from raw materials and finished powders showed that although certain species, such as B. licheniformis, were found in both raw and finished product samples, other species, such as Geobacillus spp. and Anoxybacillus spp., were more frequently isolated from finished powders. Importantly, we found that 8 out of 12 genera were isolated from at least 2 different spore count methods, suggesting that some spore count methods may provide redundant information if used in parallel. Together, our results suggest that (1) Bacillus and Geobacillus are the predominant spore contaminants in a variety of dairy powders, implying that future research efforts targeted at elucidating approaches to reduce levels of spores in dairy powders should focus on controlling levels of spore isolates from these genera; and (2) the spore populations isolated from bulk tank raw milk and some dairy powder products are significantly different, suggesting that targeting in-plant sources of contamination may be important for achieving low spore counts in the finished product. These data provide important insight regarding the diversity of spore populations isolated from dairy powders and bulk tank raw milk, and demonstrate that several spore genera are detected by multiple spore count methods.},

	abstract = {Biofilms on the surface of dairy manufacturing plants are potential reservoirs of microbial contamination. These microbial aggregates may harbour pathogenic and spoilage organisms which contaminate dairy products. The biofilm forming capacity of many spore forming isolates of dairy origin has not been given much attention. The present study explored the biofilm forming potential of 148 isolates, comprising mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, with particular emphasis on Bacillus licheniformis on polystyrene and stainless steel (SS) surfaces. We concluded that only four species are of significance for biofilm development on the surface of SS in the presence of skimmed milk, namely, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Geobacillus thermoleovorans group and Anoxybacillus flavithermus. The maximum number of cells recovered from the biofilms developed on SS coupons in the presence of skimmed milk for these four species was as follows: 4.8, 5.2, 4.5 and 5.3logCFU/cm2, respectively. Number of cells recovered from biofilms on 1cm2 SS coupons increased in the presence of tryptic soy broth (TSB) for all mesophiles including B. licheniformis, while decreased for G. stearothermophilus, G. thermoleovorans group and A. flavithermus. The crystal violet staining assay on polystyrene proved to be inadequate to predict cell counts on SS for the bacteria tested in our trial in the presence of either TSB or skimmed milk. The results support the idea that biofilm formation is an important part of bacterial survival strategy as only the most prevalent isolates from milk powders formed good biofilms on SS in the presence of skimmed milk. Biofilm formation also proved to be a strain-dependent characteristic and interestingly significant variation in biofilm formation was observed within the same RAPD groups of B. licheniformis which supports the previously reported genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity within the same RAPD based groups. The work reported in this manuscript will broaden our knowledge on biofilm formation of a large number of dairy isolates and emphasize strain and substrate dependence.},

In our study, metabolomics analysis was performed to investigate dynamic changes of the metabolites and their roles during process of biofilm development of B. licheniformis at 55 °C for 24 h. Amino acid metabolism was quite active, with cooperation from lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. Amino acid biosynthesis provided significant contributions especially during early biofilm development from 8 to 12 h. Metabolites involved in specific pathways of arginine biosynthetic, galactose metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism played a crucial role in building biofilm. This work provided new insights into dynamic metabolic alternations and a comprehensive network during B. licheniformis biofilm development, which will extend the knowledge on the metabolic process of biofilm formation by B. licheniformis.

For instance, the ABC transporter BceAB of Bacillus subtilis seems to confer resistance to bacitracin via target protection. In addition, several transporters with functions other than substrate export or import have been identified in the past. Here, we provide an overview of recent findings on ABC transporters of the Gram-positive organisms B. subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes with transport or regulatory functions affecting antibiotic resistance, cell wall biosynthesis, cell division and sporulation.},

This phenomenon is based on the heterogeneity of sporulating populations, constituted by at least two cell types: (1) sporulating cells, in which the master regulator of sporulation Spo0A is active, and (2) nonsporulating cells, in which Spo0A is inactive. Sporulating cells produce two toxins that act cooperatively to kill the nonsporulating sister cells. The nutrients released by the dead cells into the starved medium are used for growth by the sporulating cells that are not yet fully committed to sporulate, and as a result, sporulation is arrested. This review outlines the molecular mechanisms of the killing and immunity to the toxins, the regulation of their production and other examples of killing of siblings in microorganisms.

Under pathological conditions such as chronic lung inflammation, bacteria employ various mechanisms from structural changes to protease secretion to manipulate and evade the host immune response and create a niche permitting commensal bacteria to thrive into infections. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria survive in the host tissues and organs may offer new strategies to overcome persistent bacterial infections.

Accordingly, appropriate collective strategies are necessarily required for long-term growth and survival. However, in spite of our deepening knowledge of the structure and characteristics of individual cells, strategic self-organizing dynamics of their community is poorly understood and therefore not yet predictable. Here, we report a morphological change in Bacillus subtilis biofilms due to environmental pH variations, and present a mathematical model for the macroscopic spatio-temporal dynamics. We show that an environmental pH shift transforms colony morphology on hard agar media from notched ‘volcano-like’ to round and front-elevated ‘crater-like’. We discover that a pH-dependent dose-response relationship between nutritional resource level and quantitative bacterial motility at the population level plays a central role in the mechanism of the spatio-temporal cell population structure design in biofilms.},

Some environmental factors are required to trigger this differentiation process and others act by modulating it.

Understanding the survival and adaptive strategies of these bacteria under heavy metal stress is important for better utilization of these bacteria in remediation. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of bacterial extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in detoxifying against different heavy metals in Bacillus sp. S3, a new hyper antimony-oxidizing bacterium previously isolated from contaminated mine soils. The results showed that Bacillus sp. S3 is a multi-metal resistant bacterial strain, especially to Sb(III), Cu(II) and Cr(VI). Toxic Cd(II), Cr(VI) and Cu(II) could stimulate the secretion of EPS in Bacillus sp. S3, significantly enhancing the adsorption and detoxification capacity of heavy metals. Both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis further confirmed that proteins were the main compounds of EPS for metal binding. In contrast, the EPS production was not induced under Sb(III) stress. Furthermore, the TEM–EDX micrograph showed that Bacillus sp. S3 strain preferentially transported the Sb(III) to the inside of the cell rather than adsorbed it on the extracellular surface, indicating intracellular detoxification rather than extracellular EPS precipitation played an important role in microbial resistance towards Sb(III). Together, our study suggests that the toxicity response of EPS to heavy metals is associated with difference in EPS properties, metal types and corresponding environmental conditions, which is likely to contribute to microbial-mediated remediation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A functional energy metabolism is one of the most important requirements for survival of all kinds of organisms including bacteria. Therefore, many bacteria actively seek conditions of optimal metabolic activity, a behaviour which can be termed “energy taxis”. Motility, combined with the sensory perception of the internal energetic conditions, is prerequisite for tactic responses to different energy levels and metabolic yields. Diverse mechanisms of energy sensing and tactic response have evolved among various bacteria. Many of the known energy taxis sensors group among the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP)-like sensors. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of energy taxis and explores the current concept that energy taxis is an important part of the bacterial behavioural repertoire in order to navigate towards more favourable metabolic niches and to survive in a specific habitat.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly being recognized that the transfer of conjugative plasmids across species boundaries plays a vital role in the adaptability of bacterial populations in soil. There are specific driving forces and constraints of plasmid transfer within bacterial communities in soils. Plasmid-mediated genetic variation allows bacteria to respond rapidly with adaptive responses to challenges such as irregular antibiotic or metal concentrations, or opportunities such as the utilization of xenobiotic compounds. Cultivation-independent detection and capture of plasmids from soil bacteria, and complete sequencing have provided new insights into the role and ecology of plasmids. Broad host range plasmids such as those belonging to IncP-1 transfer a wealth of accessory functions which are carried by similar plasmid backbones. Plasmids with a narrower host range can be more specifically adapted to particular species and often transfer genes which complement chromosomally encoded functions. Plasmids seem to be an ancient and successful strategy to ensure survival of a soil population in spatial and temporal heterogeneous conditions with various environmental stresses or opportunities that occur irregularly or as a novel challenge in soil.},

	abstract = {In cold climate regions, microorganisms in upper layers of soil are subject to low temperatures and repeated freeze–thaw (FT) conditions during the winter. We studied the effects of cold temperature and FT cycles on the viability and survival strategies (namely motility and biofilm formation) of the common soil bacterium and model pathogen Bacillus subtilis. We also examined the effect of FT on the transport behavior of B. subtilis at two solution ionic strengths (IS: 10 and 100 mM) in quartz sand packed columns. Finally, to study the mechanical properties of the bacteria-surface bond, a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to monitor changes in bond stiffness when B. subtilis attached to a quartz substrate (model sand surface) under different environmental conditions. We observed that increasing the number of FT cycles decreased bacterial viability and that B. subtilis survived for longer time periods in higher IS solution. FT treatment decreased bacterial swimming motility and the transcription of flagellin encoding genes. Although FT exposure had no significant effect on the bacterial growth rate, it substantially decreased B. subtilis biofilm formation and correspondingly decreased the transcription of matrix production genes in higher IS solution. As demonstrated with QCM-D, the bond stiffness between B. subtilis and the quartz surface decreased after FT. Moreover, column transport studies showed higher bacterial retention onto sand grains after exposure to FT. This investigation demonstrates how temperature variations around the freezing point in upper layers of soil can influence key bacterial properties and behavior, including survival and subsequent transport.},

	abstract = {The large bacterial genus Bacillus is widely distributed in the environment and is able to colonize highly diverse niches. Some Bacillus species harbor pathogenic characteristics. The fatty acid (FA) composition is among the essential criteria used to define Bacillus species. Some elements of the FA pattern composition are common to Bacillus species, whereas others are specific and can be categorized in relation to the ecological niches of the species. Bacillus species are able to modify their FA patterns to adapt to a wide range of environmental changes, including changes in the growth medium, temperature, food processing conditions, and pH. Like many other Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus strains display a well-defined FA synthesis II system that is equilibrated with a FA degradation pathway and regulated to efficiently respond to the needs of the cell. Like endogenous FAs, exogenous FAs may positively or negatively affect the survival of Bacillus vegetative cells and the spore germination ability in a given environment. Some of these exogenous FAs may provide a powerful strategy for preserving food against contamination by the Bacillus pathogenic strains responsible for foodborne illness.},

In bacteria, the cell cycle has been extensively studied since the 1950s. Most of this research has focused on cell cycle regulation in a few model bacteria, cultured under standard growth conditions. However in nature, bacteria are exposed to drastic environmental changes. Recent work shows that by modulating their own growth and proliferation bacteria can increase their survival under stressful conditions, including antibiotic treatment. Here, we review the mechanisms that allow bacteria to integrate environmental information into their cell cycle. In particular, we focus on mechanisms controlling DNA replication and cell division. We conclude this chapter by highlighting the importance of understanding bacterial cell cycle and growth control for future research as well as other disciplines.},

This division of different cell types and organizations to form a multicellular structure by developmental programming is a key to the multitasking of complex traits that enable higher eukaryotes to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. Microbes such as bacteria, on the other hand, are unicellular and have flourished in diverse environmental conditions for a much longer time than eukaryotes in evolutionary history. In this review, we will focus on different strategies and functions exhibited by microbes that enable them to adapt to changes in lifestyle associated with transitioning from a unicellular solitary state to a complex community architecture known as a biofilm. We will also discuss various environmental stimuli and signaling processes which bacteria utilize to coordinate their social traits and enable themselves to form complex multicellular-like biofilm structures, and the division of labour operative within such communities driving their diverse social traits. We will also discuss here recent studies from our laboratory using a plant-associated bacterial pathogen as a model organism to elucidate the mechanism of bacterial cell-cell communication and the transition of a bacterial community to a multicellular-like structure driven by the complex regulation of traits influenced by cell density, as well as environmental sensing such as chemotaxis and nutrient availability. These studies are shedding important insights into bacterial developmental transitions and will help us to understand community cooperation and conflict using bacterial cell-cell communication as a model system.},

	abstract = {Bacteria can become dormant or form spores when they are starved for nutrients. Here, we find that non-sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells can survive deep starvation conditions for many months. During this period, cells adopt an almost coccoid shape and become tolerant to antibiotics. Unexpectedly, these cells appear to be metabolically active and show a transcriptome profile very different from that of stationary phase cells. We show that these starved cells are not dormant but are growing and dividing, albeit with a doubling time close to 4 days. Very low nutrient levels, comparable to 10,000-fold diluted lysogeny broth (LB), are sufficient to sustain this growth. This extreme slow growth, which we propose to call ‘oligotrophic growth state’, provides an alternative strategy for B. subtilis to endure nutrient depletion and environmental stresses. Further work is warranted to test whether this state can be found in other bacterial species to survive deep starvation conditions.},

	abstract = {Bacterial contamination of raw milk can originate from different sources: air, milking equipment, feed, soil, faeces and grass. It is hypothesized that differences in feeding and housing strategies of cows may influence the microbial quality of milk. This assumption was investigated through comparison of the aerobic spore-forming flora in milk from organic and conventional dairy farms. Laboratory pasteurized milk samples from five conventional and five organic dairy farms, sampled in late summer/autumn and in winter, were plated on a standard medium and two differential media, one screening for phospholipolytic and the other for proteolytic activity of bacteria. Almost 930 isolates were obtained of which 898 could be screened via fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Representative isolates were further analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and (GTG)(5)-PCR. The majority of aerobic spore-formers in milk belonged to the genus Bacillus and showed at least 97\% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with type strains of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus subtilis and with type strains of species belonging to the Bacillus cereus group. About 7\% of all isolates may belong to possibly new spore-forming taxa. Although the overall diversity of aerobic spore-forming bacteria in milk from organic vs. conventional dairy farms was highly similar, some differences between both were observed: (i) a relatively higher number of thermotolerant organisms in milk from conventional dairy farms compared to organic farms (41.2\% vs. 25.9\%), and (ii) a relatively higher number of B. cereus group organisms in milk from organic (81.3\%) and Ureibacillus thermosphaericus in milk from conventional (85.7\%) dairy farms. One of these differences, the higher occurrence of B. cereus group organisms in milk from organic dairy farms, may be linked to differences in housing strategy between the two types of dairy farming. However, no plausible clarification was found for the relatively higher number of thermotolerant organisms and the higher occurrence of U. thermosphaericus in milk from conventional dairy farms. Possibly this is due to differences in feeding strategy but no decisive indications were found to support this assumption.},

	abstract = {To accommodate stringent spore limits mandated for the export of dairy powders, a more thorough understanding of the spore species present will be necessary to develop prospective strategies to identify and reduce sources (i.e., raw materials or in-plant) of contamination. We characterized 1,523 spore isolates obtained from bulk tank raw milk (n=33 farms) and samples collected from 4 different dairy powder-processing plants producing acid whey, nonfat dry milk, sweet whey, or whey protein concentrate 80. The spores isolated comprised 12 genera, at least 44 species, and 216 rpoB allelic types. Bacillus and Geobacillus represented the most commonly isolated spore genera (approximately 68.9 and 12.1\%, respectively, of all spore isolates). Whereas Bacillus licheniformis was isolated from samples collected from all plants and farms, Geobacillus spp. were isolated from samples from 3 out of 4 plants and just 1 out of 33 farms. We found significant differences between the spore population isolated from bulk tank raw milk and those isolated from dairy powder plant samples, except samples from the plant producing acid whey. A comparison of spore species isolated from raw materials and finished powders showed that although certain species, such as B. licheniformis, were found in both raw and finished product samples, other species, such as Geobacillus spp. and Anoxybacillus spp., were more frequently isolated from finished powders. Importantly, we found that 8 out of 12 genera were isolated from at least 2 different spore count methods, suggesting that some spore count methods may provide redundant information if used in parallel. Together, our results suggest that (1) Bacillus and Geobacillus are the predominant spore contaminants in a variety of dairy powders, implying that future research efforts targeted at elucidating approaches to reduce levels of spores in dairy powders should focus on controlling levels of spore isolates from these genera; and (2) the spore populations isolated from bulk tank raw milk and some dairy powder products are significantly different, suggesting that targeting in-plant sources of contamination may be important for achieving low spore counts in the finished product. These data provide important insight regarding the diversity of spore populations isolated from dairy powders and bulk tank raw milk, and demonstrate that several spore genera are detected by multiple spore count methods.},

Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

It is important to understand how these cues influence biofilm development as biofilms are not only ubiquitous in nature but are also causative agents of infectious diseases. It is often believed that any stress triggers biofilm formation as a means of bacterial protection. In this study, we propose a new mechanism for how cellular and environmental DNA damage may influence biofilm formation. We demonstrate that Bacillus subtilis prevents biofilm formation and cell differentiation when stressed by oxidative DNA damage. We show that during B. subtilis biofilm development, a subpopulation of cells accumulates reactive oxygen species, which triggers the DNA damage response. Surprisingly, DNA damage response induction shuts off matrix genes whose products permit individual cells to stick together within a biofilm. We further revealed that DDRON cells and matrix producers are mutually exclusive and spatially separated within the biofilm, and that a developmental checkpoint protein, Sda, mediates the exclusiveness. We believe this represents an alternative survival strategy, ultimately allowing cells to escape the multicellular community when in danger.},

In this review, we describe the basic virology and immunology of noroviruses, the clinical disease resulting from infection and its diagnosis and management, as well as host and pathogen factors that complicate vaccine development. Additionally, we discuss overall epidemiology, infection control strategies, and global reporting efforts aimed at controlling this worldwide cause of acute gastroenteritis.

Early Cronobacter reports typically featured hospitalized and preterm infants and recognized contaminated powdered infant formula (PIF) as a transmission vehicle. To clarify recent epidemiology, we reviewed all cases of bloodstream infection or meningitis among infants that were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in the literature (1961–2018; n = 183). Most infants were neonates (100/150 [67\%]); 38\% (42/112) died, and 79\% (81/102) had reported recent PIF consumption. In the final quarter of the study period (2004–2018), case counts were significantly higher (global average 8.7 cases/year); among US cases, significantly higher proportions occurred among full-term (56\% [27/48]) and nonhospitalized (78\% [42/54]) infants. PIF contamination, most commonly from opened containers, was identified in 30\% (21/71) of investigations. Our findings reaffirm the need to promote safer alternatives for infant feeding, particularly among neonates.},

	abstract = {Cronobacter spp. has been responsible for severe infections in infants. Relative risks associated with this organism in powdered infant formula (PIF) have been described in several studies. To set priorities and decide on risk management options, it is important for risk managers to have a quantitative perspective on the absolute level of risk of this pathogen within the totality of the burden of illnesses in the population. This study set-out to establish such a perspective for The Netherlands. It addresses the impact of heterogeneity in the distribution of the micro-organism in PIF on risk levels. Based on the assumptions in this study, 60\% of formula-fed infants are estimated not to be exposed to Cronobacter spp. during their neonatal period. The mean exposure was calculated to be about 1cfu per infant over the total neonatal period. Even after thorough mixing, artificially contaminated powder shows counts which are more variable than expected from a normal, homogeneous distribution. Therefore, mean exposure levels may not represent a good basis for calculating risks. The burden of disease of Cronobacter infections to the Dutch population was estimated to be 19–24 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per year, of which 95\% are due to meningitis. As compared to other illnesses Cronobacter infections represent 0.5–2.4\% of the total estimated burden of foodborne infections and intoxications. The organism is estimated to be responsible for 0.5–0.7\% of the meningitis burden to the entire population of The Netherlands.},

	abstract = {To inform risk management decisions on control, prevention and surveillance of foodborne disease, the disease burden of foodborne pathogens is estimated using Disability Adjusted Life Years as a summary metric of public health. Fourteen pathogens that can be transmitted by food are included in the study (four infectious bacteria, three toxin-producing bacteria, four viruses and three protozoa). Data represent the burden in the Netherlands in 2009. The incidence of community-acquired non-consulting cases, patients consulting their general practitioner, those admitted to hospital, as well as the incidence of sequelae and fatal cases is estimated using surveillance data, cohort studies and published data. Disease burden includes estimates of duration and disability weights for non-fatal cases and loss of statistical life expectancy for fatal cases. Results at pathogen level are combined with data from an expert survey to assess the fraction of cases attributable to food, and the main food groups contributing to transmission. Among 1.8 million cases of disease (approx. 10,600 per 100,000) and 233 deaths (1.4 per 100,000) by these fourteen pathogens, approximately one-third (680,000 cases; 4100 per 100,000) and 78 deaths (0.5 per 100,000) are attributable to foodborne transmission. The total burden is 13,500 DALY (82 DALY per 100,000). On a population level, Toxoplasma gondii, thermophilic Campylobacter spp., rotaviruses, noroviruses and Salmonella spp. cause the highest disease burden. The burden per case is highest for perinatal listeriosis and congenital toxoplasmosis. Approximately 45\% of the total burden is attributed to food. T. gondii and Campylobacter spp. appear to be key targets for additional intervention efforts, with a focus on food and environmental pathways. The ranking of foodborne pathogens based on burden is very different compared to when only incidence is considered. The burden of acute disease is a relatively small part of the total burden. In the Netherlands, the burden of foodborne pathogens is similar to the burden of upper respiratory and urinary tract infections.},

Quantitative microbiology can be used in assessing food safety in a farm-to-fork approach. Evaluating the estimated effect of various control strategies can help to decide which combination of strategies in the chain is most effective and efficient to achieve a certain food safety objective. The potential of data analysis and quantitative microbiology is clear, yet more work needs to be done to incorporate recontamination in predictive models. The models available at the moment, although simple, can already be applied to determine the importance of (re)contamination compared with growth and inactivation of pathogens.},

Adverse human health effects from the consumption of mycotoxins have occurred for many centuries. When ingested, mycotoxins may cause a mycotoxicosis which can result in an acute or chronic disease episode. Chronic conditions have a much greater impact, numerically, on human health in general, and induce diverse and powerful toxic effects in test systems: some are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, estrogenic, hemorrhagic, immunotoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, dermotoxic and neurotoxic. Although mycotoxin contamination of agricultural products still occurs in the developed world, the application of modern agricultural practices and the presence of a legislatively regulated food processing and marketing system have greatly reduced mycotoxin exposure in these populations. However, in developing countries, where climatic and crop storage conditions are frequently conducive to fungal growth and mycotoxin production, much of the population relies on subsistence farming or on unregulated local markets. Therefore both producers and governmental control authorities are directing their efforts toward the implementation of a correct and reliable evaluation of the real status of contamination of a lot of food commodity and, consequently, of the impact of mycotoxins on human and animal health.},

	abstract = {The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable means of identifying and controlling hazards in the food production process, and thereby ensuring that food reaching the consumer is safe. The central feature of HACCP analysis is the determination of critical control points (CCPs)--those stages in the process which must be controlled to ensure the safety of the product. Once identified, a monitoring system is set up for each CCP to ensure that correct procedures are maintained and actions taken if CCP criteria are not achieved. The chief advantage of HACCP is that it is proactive; it aims to prevent problems occurring. Although HACCP is most readily applied to manufacturing processes, attempts are being made to adapt the system to other sectors of the food industry, such as catering.},

	abstract = {Listeria species are Gram-positive, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacteria, which do not produce endospores. The genus, Listeria, currently comprises 17 characterised species of which only two (L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii) are known to be pathogenic to humans. Food products and related processing environments are commonly contaminated with pathogenic species. Outbreaks and sporadic cases of human infections resulted in considerable economic loss. South Africa witnessed the world’s largest listeriosis outbreak, characterised by a progressive increase in cases of the disease from January 2017 to July 2018. Of the 1060 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis reported by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), 216 deaths were recorded. Epidemiological investigations indicated that ready-to-eat processed meat products from a food production facility contaminated with L. monocytogenes was responsible for the outbreak. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that a large proportion (91\%) of the isolates from patients were sequence type 6 (ST6). Recent studies revealed a recurrent occurrence of small outbreaks of listeriosis with more severe side-effects in humans. This review provides a comparative analysis of a recently reported and most severe outbreak of listeriosis in South Africa, with those previously encountered in other countries worldwide. The review focuses on the transmission of the pathogen, clinical symptoms of the disease and its pathogenicity. The review also focuses on the major outbreaks of listeriosis reported in different parts of the world, sources of contamination, morbidity, and mortality rates as well as cost implications. Based on data generated during the outbreak of the disease in South Africa, listeriosis was added to the South African list of mandatory notifiable medical conditions. Surveillance systems were strengthened in the South African food chain in order to assist in preventing and facilitating early detection of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of infections caused by these pathogens in humans.},

	abstract = {Background
A major food safety incident in China was made public in September 2008. Kidney and urinary tract effects, including kidney stones, affected about 300,000 Chinese infants and young children, with six reported deaths. Melamine had been deliberately added at milk-collecting stations to diluted raw milk ostensibly to boost its protein content. Subsequently, melamine has been detected in many milk and milk-containing products, as well as other food and feed products, which were also exported to many countries worldwide.

Objectives
The melamine event represents one of the largest deliberate food contamination incidents. We provide a description and analysis of this event to determine the global implications on food and feed safety.

Discussions
A series of factors, including the intentional character of the milk contamination, the young age of the population affected, the large number of potentially contaminated products, the global distribution of these products, and the delay in reporting led this event to take on unexpected proportions. This incident illustrated the complexity of international trade of food products and food ingredients that required immediate actions at international level.

Conclusion
Managing food-safety events should be done internationally and early on as soon as multinational consequences are expected. Collaboration between food-safety authorities worldwide is needed to efficiently exchange information and to enable tracking and recalling of affected products to ensure food safety and to protect public health.},

Its main consequences so far have been urinary stone formation in children with associated renal damage and increased child mortality. Eight years have passed, but food safety issues still remain of concern in the daily lives of millions of Chinese. Vigilance is required to ensure no recurrence of such food safety problems. Ongoing studies focus on the early detection of food industry malpractice, mechanisms whereby these toxic substances induce disease and how its advent may be prevented and better managed. Melamine undergoes renal excretion, but is metabolized slowly and excreted largely unchanged in the urine. Urinary melamine measurement may provide a rapid and inexpensive way to identify exposure to melamine adulterated food items. Although most patients with melaminerelated urinary stones (MUS) have been responsive to conservative treatment, longer time follow-up is needed to assess chronic effects. Aside from MUS, melamine is a recognized carcinogen and can induce urinary tract tumours. Very little is known about the effects of excessive exposure to melamine contaminated milk powder in infants on growth, adolescent and adult health, although short-term effects have become apparent during the scandal.},

Vanaf de jaren 50 tot de jaren negentig is de vleesconsumptie toegenomen. Sinds de jaren negentig is de vleesconsumptie licht gedaald, maar nog steeds hoger dan in de jaren vijftig. Nu is ruim een kwart van het eten en 10\% van het drinken van dierlijke oorsprong. Het RIVM heeft de voedselconsumptie, en factoren die de voedselconsumptie beïnvloeden in kaart gebracht. In de laatste decennia, is het aantal verschillende voedingsmiddelen toegenomen, komen voedingsmiddelen uit de hele wereld, eten we meer bewerkt voedsel en minder basisvoedingsmiddelen. We kopen voedingsmiddelen vaker in supermarkten en besteden minder tijd aan voedselbereiding. Er zijn kleine maar groeiende groepen consumenten die bewust kiezen om gezond of duurzaam te eten. Consumenten maken de meeste voedselkeuzes gebaseerd op routine en gewoonte. Kennis en motivatie spelen een relatief kleine rol bij voedselkeuze. Bij de motivatie om veilig, gezond en duurzaam te eten, gaat de consument bovendien uit van de eigen perceptie, die niet altijd overeen komt met de wetenschappelijke consensus.

We reviewed 57 global food security projection and quantitative scenario studies that have been published in the past two decades and discussed the methods, underlying drivers, indicators and projections. Across five representative scenarios that span divergent but plausible socio-economic futures, the total global food demand is expected to increase by 35\% to 56\% between 2010 and 2050, while population at risk of hunger is expected to change by −91\% to +8\% over the same period. If climate change is taken into account, the ranges change slightly (+30\% to +62\% for total food demand and −91\% to +30\% for population at risk of hunger) but with no statistical differences overall. The results of our review can be used to benchmark new global food security projections and quantitative scenario studies and inform policy analysis and the public debate on the future of food.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) are believed to account in part for the persistence of S. aureus during chronic infections. Little is understood about the gene expression profile that may explain the phenotype and distinguish SCVs from prototype S. aureus strains. In this study, DNA array transcriptional profiles of clinical SCVs isolated from the airways of cystic fibrosis patients were obtained and compared to those obtained from a laboratory-derived SCV strain (i.e., a respiratory-deficient hemB mutant) and prototype S. aureus strains. The genes commonly up-regulated in both hemB and clinical SCVs were found to be implicated in fermentation and glycolysis pathways. The well-known virulence regulator agr was not activated in SCVs, and such strains had low levels of alpha-toxin (hla) gene expression. Clinical SCVs also had a transcriptional signature of their own. Of striking interest is that many genes, most of them under the positive control of the alternate sigma factor SigB, were specifically up-regulated and differed in that way from that seen in prototype S. aureus and the hemB mutant. Since SigB influences up-regulation of adhesin type genes while indirectly down-regulating exoproteins and toxins, we evaluated the internalization and persistence of SCVs in mammalian cells. Results showed that clinical SCVs persisted much more efficiently in cells than the hemB and prototype strains and that a sigB mutant was a poor persister. Thus, it appears that the agr locus plays a minor role in the regulation of the virulon of SCVs, unlike SigB, which may have a key role in intracellular persistence.},

	abstract = {Microarray-based analysis of the transcriptional profiles of the genetically distinct Staphylococcus aureus strains COL, GP268, and Newman indicate that a total of 251 open reading frames (ORFs) are influenced by σB activity. While σB was found to positively control 198 genes by a factor of ≥2 in at least two of the three genetic lineages analyzed, 53 ORFs were repressed in the presence of σB. Gene products that were found to be influenced by σB are putatively involved in all manner of cellular processes, including cell envelope biosynthesis and turnover, intermediary metabolism, and signaling pathways. Most of the genes and/or operons identified as upregulated by σB were preceded by a nucleotide sequence that resembled the σB consensus promoter sequence of Bacillus subtilis. A conspicuous number of virulence-associated genes were identified as regulated by σB activity, with many adhesins upregulated and prominently represented in this group, while transcription of various exoproteins and toxins were repressed. The data presented here suggest that the σB of S. aureus controls a large regulon and is an important modulator of virulence gene expression that is likely to act conversely to RNAIII, the effector molecule of the agr locus. We propose that this alternative transcription factor may be of importance for the invading pathogen to fine-tune its virulence factor production in response to changing host environments.},

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline HCl and gentamicin sulphate against EGDeΔsigB were two- and fourfold less than those for EGDe, respectively. The ability of EGDeΔsigB to overcome the growth arrest caused by erythromycin and rifampin was also weaker than that of EGDe. The transcription analysis of four genetic loci (known to be induced by rifampin in Bacillus subtili) kat, fri, ropB and rsbU in EGDe and EGDeΔsigB in the absence or presence of rifampin revealed that: (1) expression of kat and fri genes is σ                         (B) dependent, but only the former is inducible by rifampin stress; (2) the transcriptional level of rpoB gene was stable under all the experimental conditions, while that of rsbU in EGDeΔsigB was remarkably higher in the absence of rifampin and significantly increased in EGDe but reduced in EGDeΔsigB after rifampin application, when compared to those in EGDe and EGDeΔsigB control without antibiotic, respectively. These results suggest that complex physiological reactions to tolerance of the antibiotic stress are variably regulated in bacteria, and in contrast to B. subtilis, rsbU in EGDeΔsigB may compensate for the σ                         (B)-dependent genes that are necessary for tolerance to rifampin stress and therefore plays a role in overcoming the antibiotic-triggered growth arrest.},

In this study, we demonstrate that profound physiological changes permit Bacillus cereus to switch from a floating to a sessile lifestyle, to undergo further maturation of the biofilm and to differentiate into the offensive or defensive features. We report that floating and biofilm cells are populations that differentiate metabolically, with members of each subpopulation developing different branches of certain metabolic pathways. Secondly, biofilm populations rearrange nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, and energy metabolism. Thirdly, this metabolic rearrangement coexists with: the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, sporulation, reinforcement of the cell wall, activation of the ROS detoxification machinery and production of secondary metabolites. This strategy contributes to defend biofilm cells from competitors. However, floating cells maintain a fermentative metabolic status that ensures a higher aggressiveness against hosts, evidenced by the production of toxins. The maintenance of the two distinct subpopulations is an effective strategy to face different environmental conditions found in the life styles of B. cereus.},

	abstract = {Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. R.J. Gibbons made the first reports of the clinical relevance of what we now know as bacterial biofilms when he published his observations of the role of polysaccharide glycocalyx formation on teeth by Streptococcus mutans [Sci. Am. 238 (1978) 86]. As the clinical relevance of bacterial biofilm formation became increasingly apparent, interest in the phenomenon exploded. Studies are rapidly shedding light on the biomolecular pathways leading to this sessile mode of growth but many fundamental questions remain. The intent of this review is to consider the reasons why bacteria switch from a free-floating to a biofilm mode of growth. The currently available wealth of data pertaining to the molecular genetics of biofilm formation in commonly studied, clinically relevant, single-species biofilms will be discussed in an effort to decipher the motivation behind the transition from planktonic to sessile growth in the human body. Four potential incentives behind the formation of biofilms by bacteria during infection are considered: (1) protection from harmful conditions in the host (defense), (2) sequestration to a nutrient-rich area (colonization), (3) utilization of cooperative benefits (community), (4) biofilms normally grow as biofilms and planktonic cultures are an in vitro artifact (biofilms as the default mode of growth).},

During long incubation at 30 °C, pH decreased due to bacterial development in unadjusted samples. In pH-adjusted samples, pH was kept at around 7.0 by the addition of sterile sodium hydroxide. Biofilms formed on stainless steel coupons were daily stained by 0.1\% Crystal Violet solution and assessed by the evaluation of optical density. The bacterial count of the suspensions showed that the control of pH enhanced the growth of bacteria in free-floating form. In contrast, optical densities of biofilms formed in the pH-adjusted samples were significantly lower than in the pH-unadjusted samples in all of three skim milk dilutions. Comparison of maximum OD values of adhered cells at different nutrient levels also implicated that for both tested strains, thicker biofilms were formed in milk dilutions at higher nutrient levels. These results suggested that, control of milk pH and milk residue level could significantly reduce biofilm formation of the tested bacteria.},

Regulation of the synthesis of fatty acids and beta-hydroxy fatty acids was studied by modifying the culture medium. Addition of branched-chain alpha-amino acids to the medium caused similar changes to both cellular fatty acid and to beta-hydroxy fatty acid composition in the lipophilic part of lichenysin A. Production of lichenysin A was enhanced about two- and four-fold by addition of L-glutamic acid and L-asparagine respectively. It is suggested that these amino acids may be involved in the control of lipopeptide formation. Elucidation of the structure-function relationship of surface-active lipopeptides by analysis of the activities of structurally characterized compounds is discussed. Fractions of lichenysin A with branched beta-hydroxy acids in the lipid tail demonstrated lower surface-tension activity than the fractions of lichenysin A having straight beta-hydroxy acids. The presence of a lichenysin A fraction with beta-hydroxymyristic [(C14)n] acid residues appears to have an important influence on the surface activity of a mixture of lichenysins A.},

Although there is substantial interest in the generation of greater peptide diversity, in order to create new biotechnologically interesting products, attempts reported so far to exchange amino acid-activating minimal modules between enzymes have only yielded hybrid catalysts with poor activities. We report here the replacement of an entire first, L-Glu-, and fifth, L-Asp-incorporating modules of surfactin synthetase, to create a fully active hybrid enzyme that forms a novel peptide in high yields. Whole encoding regions of lichenysin A synthetase modules were introduced into surfactin biosynthesis operon between His140/His1185 of SrfAA and His1183/His2226 of SrfAB, the amino acid residues of a proposed active-site motif (HHXXXDG) of the condensation domains which is involved in the catalysis of nonribosomal peptide bond formation (Stachelhaus et al., 1998). When the lipopeptides produced by the recombinant Bacillus subtilis strains were purified and characterized, they appeared to be expressed approximately at the same level of the wild type surfactin and to be identical by their fatty acid profiles. We thereby demonstrate the utility of whole module swapping for designing novel peptides, for creating peptide diversity, and for redesigning existing peptides produced in performant production strains in high yields to correspond to desired peptides produced in low yields, or from strains unsuitable for production purposes.},

With this method, cell seeding densities can be standardised, overcoming problems with methods based on mechanical dissociation of organoids. Confluent monolayers formed tight junctions with high transepithelial electrical resistance in three days and could be used in experiments for up to two weeks. Multilineage differentiation of ileal stem cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR of cell-specific transcripts, also unequivocally confirming the controversial existence of Paneth-like cells in the porcine small intestine.

They have the capacity to lower the surface tension of water from 72 to 27 mN/m. Based on species specific variations they are named lichenysin A, B, C, D, G and surfactant BL86. The lowest ever interfacial tension against decane of 0.006 mN/m is obtained with acid precipitated lichenysin B. Surfactant BL86 and lichenysin B have recorded lowest ever CMC of 10 mg/L by any surfactant under optimal conditions. Surface and interfacial tension lowering ability bears significance in the context of oil recovery from oil reservoir. Similarity exists between structure and biosynthesis of surfactin and lichenysin. Surfactin being the most studied of the two, understanding its structure and biosynthesis gives an insight into the structure and biosynthesis of lichenysin. Lichenysin is synthesized by a multienzyme complex, lichenysin synthetase (LchA/Lic) encoded by 32.4 (26.6 kb) lichenysin operon lchA (lic). The structure of lichenysin and its operon indicate the nonribosomal biosynthesis with the same multifunctional modular arrangement as seen in surfactin synthetase SrfA. The lchA operon consists of lchAA-AC (lic A-C) and lchA TE (licTE) genes encoding the proteins LchAA, LchAB, LchAC and thioesterase LchA-TE. The licA (lchAA) gene is 10,746 bp and codes for a 3,582 amino acids protein, licB (lchAB) gene is 10,764 bp and codes for a similar sized protein, while licC (lchAC) gene is 3,864 bp and codes for protein containing 1,288 amino acid. The biotechnological potential of lichenysin in MEOR has triggered research on structure-activity relationship. Both the nature of peptide and fatty acid dictate the activity of the biosurfactant. Tailormade biosurfactant with desired attributes can be obtained from engineered synthetases. Basic studies are lacking on mechanism of biosynthesis by lichenysin synthetase however, studies on various aspects of lichenysin including regulation are expected to swell in coming years.},

It was found that cellular growth and surfactin production in MSM were greatly affected by the environmental fermentation conditions and the medium components (carbon and nitrogen sources and minerals). Optimum environmental conditions for high surfactin production on the shake flask level were found to be a slightly acidic initial pH (6.5-6.8), an incubation temperature of 30 degrees C, a 90\% volumetric aeration percentage, and an inoculum size of 2\% v/v. For media components, it was found that the optimum carbon source was molasses (160 ml/l), whereas the optimum nitrogen source was NaNO(3) (5 g/l) and the optimum trace elements were ZnSO(4).7H(2)O (0.16 g/l), FeCl(3).6H(2)O (0.27 g/l), and MnSO(4).H(2)O (0.017 g/l). A modified MSM (molasses MSM), combining the optimum medium components, was formulated and resulted in threefold increase in surfactin productivity that reached 1.12 g/l. No plasmid could be detected in the tested isolate, revealing that biosurfactant production by B. subtilis isolate BS5 is chromosomally mediated but not plasmid-mediated.},

However, almost no iturin A was produced in its first 24 hours of cultivation and the production of iturin A began much later. Volumes of the nutrient medium and available surface area of the biofilm reactors were found to be important with the relative production of these two antibiotics. Production of iturin A was increased from 12 mg to about 50 mg per reactor when the culture size was increased from 5 mL to 20 mL, as the depth of the medium was increased. The production level was saturated thereafter with larger volumes. On the other hand, surfactin production was remained similar, which was about 10 mg per reactor, from all the 5 mL to 80 mL of biofilm culture. Optimized temperature for iturin A and surfactin production was observed at 25 and 37°C, respectively. In the biofilm fermentation, production of surfactin was increased when the incubation temperature was increased within the temperature range of 25 to 37°C, on the other hand, iturin A production was gradually decreased with the increase of the incubation temperature.},

RESULTS: An economical medium containing molasses was optimized to enhance lichenysin production by RSM. A production of 3·2 g l(-1) of lichenysin was achieved with an optimum medium containing 107·82 g l(-1) of molasses, 6·47 g l(-1) of NaNO3 and 9·7 g l(-1) of K2 HPO4 /KH2 PO4 , in which molasses and phosphate salts had a significant effect on biosurfactant production. Lichenysin was effectively applied in a surface pre-treatment to avoid microbial biofilm development of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (68·73\%) and Candida albicans (74·35\%), with ED50 values of 8·3 and 17·2 μg ml(-1) respectively. It was also very efficient in a surface post-treatment to remove biofilms of MRSA (55·74\%) and Yersinia enterocolitica (51·51\%), with an ED50 of 2·79 and 4·09 μg ml(-1) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Lichenysin was found to have notable anti-adhesion activity, being able to prevent and eliminate the biofilm formation by pathogenic strains associated with foodborne illness. This new medium resulted in a four-fold increase in production compared with the nonoptimized medium.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Molasses can be regarded as a useful resource for biotechnological applications, such as the production of lichenysin. The use of agro-industrial substrates has an important role in the sustainable and competitive development of several industrial sectors, as well as in industrial residues management. Additionally, lichenysin is particularly effective in preventing biofilm formation by strains problematic for the food industry and in the hospital environment. Lichenysin also efficiently disrupts biofilm.},

Strain AL 1.1, isolated on Deception Island (Antarctica), identified as Bacillus licheniformis, produced lipopeptides when grown using a variety of carbohydrates. Biosurfactant production, but not growth, was optimal at 30 °C. The culture conditions and medium composition dictated biosurfactant production. Basic optimization of culture and extraction parameters gave a production yiels of 860 mg/L purified extract in 24 h. The purified biosurfactant yielded a mixture of lipopeptide homologues, with molecular weights between 1006 and 1034. The peptide moiety consists of glutamine as the N-terminal amino acid, two leucines, valine, aspartic, leucine and isoleucine as the C-terminal amino acid. The lipid moiety contains a mixture of β-hydroxy fatty acids ranging in size from C14 to C16. These results indicate a similarity with lichenysin groups A, D or G. The organic extract reduced surface tension to 28.5 mN/m and achieved a critical micelle concentration of 15 mg/L. This highly effective and efficient behavior characterized the product as a powerful surfactant. Its stability under a wide pH range, high temperatures and variable concentrations of salt, as well as its emulsifying properties, suggest potential application in cosmetic industrial processes.},

Lichenysin alters the thermotropic phase behavior of phosphatidylcholines, displaying fluid-phase immiscibility and showing a preferential partitioning into fluid domains. The interlamellar repeat distance of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is modified, affecting both the phospholipid palisade and the lipid/water interface, which also experiences a strong dehydration. Molecular dynamics confirms that Lichenysin is capable of interacting both with the hydrophobic portion of DPPC and with the polar headgroup region, which is of particular relevance to explain much of its properties. The results presented here help to establish a molecular basis for the Lichenysin-induced perturbation of model and biological membranes previously described in the literature.},

	abstract = {The effluent produced in refineries is in the form of an oil/water emulsion that must be treated. These emulsions are often stable and a suitable method must be used to separate the oil from the emulsion. Recently, biosurfactants or biodemulsifiers have received much attention to reduce the interfacial tension between two liquids. Biodemulsifiers are produced by microorganisms and have several benefits over chemical demulsifiers such as low-toxic, biodegradability, eco-friendly and easy synthesis. They can eliminate two phases by changing the interfacial forces between the water and oil molecules. Biosurfactants are categorized based on the molecular weight of their compounds (low or high molecular weight). Sophorolipids, lipopeptides rhamnolipids, trehalolipids, glycolipid, lipoproteins, lichenysin, surfactin, and polymeric biosurfactants are several types of biosurfactants, which are produced by bacteria or fungi. This review study provides a deep evaluation of biosurfactants in the demulsification process. To this end, different types of biosurfactants, the synthesis method of various biosurfactants using various microorganisms, features of biosurfactants, and the role of biodemulsifiers in the demulsification process are thoroughly discussed. Also, the impact of various efficient factors like pH, microorganism type, temperature, the oil content in the emulsion, and gravity on biodemulsificaion was studied. Finally, the mechanism of the demulsification process was discussed. According to previous studies, rhamnolipid biodemulsifier showed the highest biodemulsification efficiency (100\%) in the removal of oil from an emulsion.},

Combining data on oxidative burst induction in tobacco cells, structure/activity relationship, competitive inhibition, insertion kinetics within plant membranes and thermodynamic determination of binding parameters on model membranes globally indicates that surfactin perception relies on a lipid-driven process at the plasma membrane level. Such a sensor role of the lipid bilayer is quite uncommon considering that plant basal immunity is usually triggered upon recognition of microbial molecular patterns by high-affinity proteic receptors.},

The state of the art of sporeformer prevalence in ingredients and food was investigated using a multiparametric PCR-based tool that enables simultaneous detection and identification of various genera and species mostly encountered in food, i.e., Alicyclobacillus, Anoxybacillus flavithermus, Bacillus, B. cereus group, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, B. sporothermodurans, B. subtilis, Brevibacillus laterosporus, Clostridium, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Moorella and Paenibacillus species. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing was used to extend identification to other possibly present contaminants. A total of 90 food products, with or without visible trace of spoilage were analysed, i.e., 30 egg-based products, 30 milk and dairy products and 30 canned food and ingredients. Results indicated that most samples contained one or several of the targeted genera and species. For all three tested food categories, 30 to 40\% of products were contaminated with both Bacillus and Clostridium. The percentage of contaminations associated with Clostridium or Bacillus represented 100\% in raw materials, 72\% in dehydrated ingredients and 80\% in processed foods. In the last two product types, additional thermophilic contaminants were identified (A. flavithermus, Geobacillus spp., Thermoanaerobacterium spp. and Moorella spp.). These results suggest that selection, and therefore the observed (re)-emergence of unexpected sporeforming contaminants in food might be favoured by the use of given food ingredients and food processing technologies.},

Sections of these cases were re-examined microscopically and immunohistochemically by a PAP technique using a primary antibody against B. licheniformis. Of these abortions, 47 were most likely associated with B. licheniformis as tissue lesions with immunostained bacteria were present in these. In the remaining cases the diagnosis may not have been established due to the lack of sufficient materials, or the isolation of the bacterium was considered to be a result of contamination. In four cases concomitant infections with B. licheniformis and bovine virus diarrhoea virus were present. Abortions caused by B. licheniformis were predominantly seen during the winter months and in late pregnancy. The most common lesions were necrotizing placentitis followed by fetal multifocal suppurative bronchopneumonia. Immunohistochemically, B. licheniformis was demonstrated in association with tissue lesions and intracellularly in trophoblasts. The pattern of bacterial isolations, especially from the placenta, lungs, and abomasal contents, combined with the histological findings points to B. licheniformis abortions as being of haematogenous origin with subsequent transplacental spread to the fetus.},

This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important for controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments., Bacterial biofilms are important in natural settings, biotechnology, and medicine. However, regulation of biofilm development and its persistence in different niches is complex and only partially understood. One key step during the biofilm life cycle is dispersal, when motile cells abandon the mature biofilm to spread out and colonize new niches. Here, we show that in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the general stress transcription factor SigB is essential for halting detrimental overgrowth of mature biofilm and for triggering dispersal when nutrients become limited. Specifically, SigB-deficient biofilms were larger than wild-type biofilms but exhibited accelerated cell death, significantly greater sensitivity to different stresses, and reduced dispersal. Interestingly, the signal detected by SigB to limit biofilm growth was transduced through the RsbP-dependent metabolic arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, which in turn positively controlled expression of SinR, the master regulator of biofilm formation and cell motility. This novel SigB-SinR regulatory circuit might be important in controlling the fitness of biofilms (either beneficial or harmful) in diverse environments., IMPORTANCE Biofilms are crucial for bacterial survival, adaptation, and dissemination in natural, industrial, and medical systems.

Here, we show how stochastic pulsing of gene expression enables spatial patterns to form in a model multicellular system, Bacillus subtilis bacterial biofilms. We use quantitative microscopy and time-lapse imaging to observe pulses in the activity of the general stress response sigma factor σB in individual cells during biofilm development. Both σB and sporulation activity increase in a gradient, peaking at the top of the biofilm, even though σB represses sporulation. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, increasing σB expression shifts the peak of sporulation to the middle of the biofilm. Our results demonstrate how stochastic pulsing of gene expression can play a key role in pattern formation during biofilm development.},

Here we show that the coding genes for both regulatory proteins are dramatically induced, during logarithmic growth, after a temperature downshift from 37 to 20 degrees C. The loss of sigma(B) reduces the stationary-phase viability of cold-adapted cells 10- to 50-fold. Furthermore, we show that sigma(B) activity is required at a late stage of development for efficient sporulation at a low temperature. On the other hand, Spo0A loss dramatically reduces the stationary-phase viability of cold-adapted cells 10,000-fold. We show that the requirement of Spo0A for cellular survival during the cold is independent of the activity of the key transition state regulator AbrB and of the simple loss of sporulation ability. Furthermore, Spo0A, and not proficiency in sporulation, is required for the development of complete stress resistance of cold-adapted cells to heat shock (54 degrees C, 1 h), since a loss of Spo0A, but not a loss of the essential sporulation transcription factor sigma(F), reduced the cellular survival in response to heat by more than 1,000-fold. The overall results argue for new and important roles for Spo0A in the development of full stress resistance by nonsporulating cells and for sigma(B) in sporulation proficiency at a low temperature.},

To understand the regulation of SigB activity by RsbV and RsbW based on structural features, crystal structures and a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) envelope structure of the RsbV-RsbW complex were determined. The crystal structures showed that RsbV and RsbW form a heterotetramer in a similar manner to a SpoIIAA-SpoIIAB tetramer. Multi-angle light scattering and SAXS revealed that the RsbV-RsbW complex is an octamer in solution. Superimposition of the crystal structure on the SAXS envelope structure showed that the unique dimeric interface of RsbW mediates the formation of an RsbV-RsbW octamer and does not prevent RsbV and SigB from binding to RsbW. These results provide structural insights into the molecular assembly of the RsbV-RsbW complex and the regulation of SigB activity.},

The gene cluster was very similar to the Bacillus subtilis sigB operon both in the primary sequences of the gene products and in the order of its three genes. However, the deduced products of sequences upstream and downstream from this operon showed no similarity to other proteins encoded by the B. subtilis sigB operon. Therefore, the B. anthracis sigB operon contains three genes rather than eight as in B. subtilis. The B. anthracis operon is preceded by a sigma(B)-like promoter sequence, the expression of which depends on an intact sigma(B) transcription factor in B. subtilis. It is followed by another open reading frame that is also preceded by a promoter sequence similarly dependent on B. subtilis sigma(B). We found that in B. anthracis, both these promoters were induced during the stationary phase and induction required an intact sigB gene. The sigB operon was induced by heat shock. Mutants from which sigB was deleted were constructed in a toxinogenic and a plasmidless strain. These mutants differed from the parental strains in terms of morphology. The toxinogenic sigB mutant strain was also less virulent than the parental strain in the mouse model. B. anthracis sigma(B) may therefore be a minor virulence factor.},

Here, we assessed the role of SigB during the infectious cycle of B. thuringiensis in a Galleria mellonella insect model. We used a fluorescent reporter coupled to flow cytometry and showed that SigB was activated in vivo We also showed that the pathogenicity of the ΔsigB mutant was severely affected when inoculated via the oral route, suggesting that SigB is critical for B. thuringiensis adaptation to the gut environment of the insect. We could not detect an effect of the sigB deletion on the survival of the bacteria or on their sporulation efficiency in the cadavers.

Several Gram-positive species have developed an adaptive response mediated by the general stress response alternative sigma factor SigB.

Using antibody raised against sigma-37 holoenzyme to probe a lambda gt11 expression vector library, we isolated a 901-base-pair EcoRI fragment that expressed the COOH-terminal half of sigma-37 fused to lacZ. We used this fragment as a hybridization probe to isolate the entire rpoF gene and additional flanking sequences. Identity of the cloned gene was confirmed by the size and immunological reaction of its product expressed in Escherichia coli and, after DNA sequencing, by the homology of its predicted product (264 residues; 30,143 daltons) with other sigma factors. The DNA sequence also suggested that rpoF may lie in a gene cluster. Upstream of rpoF was an open reading frame that would encode a protein of 17,992 daltons; this frame overlapped the rpoF-coding sequence by 41 base pairs. Immediately following rpoF was a reading frame that would encode a protein of at least 20,000 daltons; expression of this region may be translationally coupled to that of rpoF. By plasmid integration and PBS1 transduction, we found the chromosomal locus of rpoF linked to ddl and dal at 40 degrees on the B. subtilis map and near no known lesions affecting growth regulation or development. Further, an rpoF null mutation resulting from gene disruption had no effect on cell growth or sporulation in rich medium, suggesting that sigma-37 may partly control a regulon not directly involved in the sporulation process.},

SigB is critical for the cell's response to general stress but is also expressed during spore germination and outgrowth, and this specific regulon is not known. This approach allowed us to (i) define a subset of the known SigB regulon controlled by SigB specifically during spore germination and outgrowth, (ii) identify the influence of the promoter sequence binding motif organization on the expression of the SigB-regulated genes, and (iii) suggest additional sigma factors co-controlling other SigB-dependent genes. Experiments then validated promoter sequence characteristics necessary for direct RNAP-SigB binding.

	abstract = {The heat and ethanol stress response of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 was analyzed at the transcriptional and/or translational level. During heat shock, regulons known to be heat-induced in Bacillus subtilis 168 are upregulated in B. licheniformis, such as the HrcA, SigB, CtsR, and CssRS regulon. Upregulation of the SigY regulon and of genes controlled by other extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors indicates a cell-wall stress triggered by the heat shock. Furthermore, tryptophan synthesis enzymes were upregulated in heat stressed cells as well as regulons involved in usage of alternative carbon and nitrogen sources. Ethanol stress led to an induction of the SigB, HrcA, and CtsR regulons. As indicated by the upregulation of a SigM-dependent protein, ethanol also triggered a cell wall stress. To characterize the SigB regulon of B. licheniformis, we analyzed the heat stress response of a sigB mutant. It is shown that the B. licheniformis SigB regulon comprises additional genes, some of which do not exist in B. subtilis, such as BLi03885, encoding a hypothetical protein, the Na/solute symporter gene BLi02212, the arginase homolog-encoding gene BLi00198 and mcrA, encoding a protein with endonuclease activity.},

A short section at the end of the chapter summarizes the roles of general stress regulons in the physiology of gram-positive organisms that possess sB, or σB-like factors. In Bacillus subtilis, RsbW has two activities in unstressed cells: (i) as an anti-sigma factor it binds σB and prevents its association with RNA polymerase; and (ii) as a serine kinase it specifically phosphorylates and inactivates its own antagonist, the RsbV anti- anti-sigma. Three single-domain anti-anti- sigma factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have atypical N-terminal extensions rich in serine and threonine residues, allowing their interactions to be controlled by a unique mechanism that may affect σF activity. In many gram-positive bacteria σB is a master regulator of a general stress modulon that closely interacts with other global systems. Investigation of the roles of genes in the modulon can provide a unique perspective regarding the physiological changes that promote stress resistance. How σB signaling networks sense activating stresses remains an open question. Given the wide distribution of the recognized sensing modules and their association with different output domains, this question is relevant to many signaling pathways.},

In the human pathogen Bacillus cereus, activation of the major stress-responsive sigma factor σ B is controlled by a signalling route that involves the multi-sensor hybrid histidine kinase RsbK. RsbK-type kinases are not restricted to the B. cereus group, but occur in a wide variety of other bacterial species, including members of the the low-GC Gram-positive genera Geobacillus and Paenibacillus as well as the high-GC actinobacteria. Genome context and protein sequence analyses of 118 RsbK homologues revealed extreme variability in N-terminal sensory as well as C-terminal regulatory domains and suggested that RsbK-type kinases are subject to complex fine-tuning systems, including sensitization and desensitization via methylation and demethylation within the helical domain preceding the H-box. The RsbK-mediated stress-responsive sigma factor activation mechanism that has evolved in B. cereus and the other species differs markedly from the extensively studied and highly conserved RsbRST-mediated σ B activation route found in Bacillus subtilis and other low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Implications for future research on sigma factor control mechanisms are presented and current knowledge gaps are briefly discussed.,},

	doi = {10.1128/JB.00486-21},
	abstract = {The survival of microbial cells under changing environmental conditions requires an efficient reprogramming of transcription, often mediated by alternative sigma factors. The Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes senses and responds to environmental stress mainly through the alternative sigma factor σB (SigB), which controls expression of the general stress response regulon. SigB activation is achieved through a complex series of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events culminating in the release of SigB from its anti-sigma factor RsbW. At the top of the signal transduction pathway lies a large multi-protein complex known as the stressosome that is believed to act as a sensory hub for stresses. Following signal detection, stressosome proteins become phosphorylated. Resetting of the stressosome is hypothesized to be exerted by a putative phosphatase, RsbX, which presumably removes phosphate groups from stressosome proteins post-stress. We addressed the role of the RsbX protein in modulating the activity of the stressosome and consequently regulating SigB activity in L. monocytogenes. We show that RsbX is required to reduce SigB activation/levels under non-stress conditions and that it is required for appropriate SigB mediated stress-adaptation. A strain lacking RsbX displayed impaired motility and biofilm formation, but also an increased survival at low pH. Our results could suggest that absence of RsbX alter the multi-protein composition of the stressosome without dramatically affecting its phosphorylation status. Overall the data show that RsbX plays a critical role in modulating the signal transduction pathway by blocking SigB activation under non-stressed conditions. Importance Pathogenic bacteria need to sense and respond to stresses to survive harsh environments but also be able to turn off the response when no longer facing stress. Activity of the stress-sigma factor SigB in the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is controlled by a hierarchic system having a large stress-sensing multiprotein complex known as the stressosome at the top. Following stress exposure, proteins in the stressosome become phosphorylated leading to SigB activation. We have studied the role of a putative phosphatase, RsbX, which is hypothesized to dephosphorylate stressosome proteins. RsbX is not only critical to switch off the stress response post-stress but also to keep the activity of SigB low at non-stressed conditions to prevent unnecessary gene-expression and save energy.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes sigma(B) and positive regulatory factor A (PrfA) are pleiotropic transcriptional regulators that coregulate a subset of virulence genes. A positive regulatory role for sigma(B) in prfA transcription has been well established; therefore, observations of increased virulence gene expression and hemolytic activity in a DeltasigB strain initially appeared paradoxical. To test the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes sigma(B) contributes to a regulatory network critical for appropriate repression as well as induction of virulence gene expression, genome-wide transcript profiling and follow-up quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), reporter fusion, and phenotypic experiments were conducted using L. monocytogenes prfA*, prfA* DeltasigB, DeltaprfA, and DeltaprfA DeltasigB strains. Genome-wide transcript profiling and qRT-PCR showed that in the presence of active PrfA (PrfA*), sigma(B) is responsible for reduced expression of the PrfA regulon. sigma(B)-dependent modulation of PrfA regulon expression reduced the cytotoxic effects of a PrfA* strain in HepG2 cells, highlighting the functional importance of regulatory interactions between PrfA and sigma(B). The emerging model of the role of sigma(B) in regulating overall PrfA activity includes a switch from transcriptional activation at the P2(prfA) promoter (e.g., in extracellular bacteria when PrfA activity is low) to posttranscriptional downregulation of PrfA regulon expression (e.g., in intracellular bacteria when PrfA activity is high).},

	doi = {10.1128/AEM.00397-21},
	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and intracellular pathogen that responds to stress using predominantly the alternative sigma factor SigB. Stress is sensed by a multiprotein complex, the stressosome, extensively studied in bacteria grown in nutrient media. Following signal perception, the stressosome triggers a phosphorylation cascade that releases SigB from its anti-sigma factor. Whether the stressosome is activated during the intracellular infection is unknown. Here, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of stressosome proteins in L. monocytogenes located inside epithelial cells following their immunodetection in membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from intracellular bacteria. Unlike bacteria in laboratory media, intracellular bacteria have a large proportion of the core stressosome protein RsbR1 associated with the membrane. However, another core protein, RsbS, is undetectable. Despite the absence of RsbS, a SigB-dependent reporter revealed that SigB activity increases gradually from early (1 h) to late (6 h) postinfection times. We also found that RsbR1 paralogues attenuate the intensity of the SigB response and that the miniprotein Prli42, reported to tether the stressosome to the membrane in response to oxidative stress, plays no role in associating RsbR1 to the membrane of intracellular bacteria. Altogether, these data indicate that, once inside host cells, the L. monocytogenes stressosome may adopt a unique configuration to sense stress and to activate SigB in the intracellular eukaryotic niche. IMPORTANCE The response to stress mediated by the alternative sigma factor SigB has been extensively characterized in Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes. These bacteria sense stress using a supramacromolecular complex, the stressosome, which triggers a cascade that releases SigB from its anti-sigma factor. Despite the fact that many structural data on the complex are available and analyses have been performed in mutants lacking components of the stressosome or the signaling cascade, the integration of the stress signal and the dynamics of stressosome proteins following environmental changes remain poorly understood. Our study provides data at the protein level on essential stressosome components and SigB activity when L. monocytogenes, normally a saprophytic bacterium, adapts to an intracellular lifestyle. Our results support activation of the stressosome complex in intracellular bacteria. The apparent loss of the stressosome core protein RsbS in intracellular L. monocytogenes also challenges current models, favoring the idea of a unique stressosome architecture responding to intracellular host cues.},

Under stress conditions, the phosphatase RsbU triggers release of sigma(B) and thus induces the expression of stress genes. RsbU activity is controlled by three proteins, RsbR, RsbS and RsbT which form a supramolecular complex called the stressosome. Here we review the occurrence of the genes encoding the stressosome proteins (called the RsbRST module) in a wide variety of bacteria. While this module is linked to the gene encoding sigma(B) and its direct regulators in B. subtilis and its close relatives, genes encoding two-component regulatory systems and more complex phosphorelays are clustered with the RsbRST module in bacteria as diverse as cyanobacteria, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and deinococci. The conservation of the RsbRST module and its clustering with different types of regulatory systems suggest that the stressosome proteins form a signal sensing and transduction unit that relays information to very different output modules.},

It encodes a polypeptide of 281 amino acids (31 546 Da) and is highly homologous to Bacillus subtilis sigmaB. The sigB coding region is preceded by four open reading frames (ORFs): dpsA, orfA, rsbB and rsbA in sequential order. RNA analyses revealed that rsbB, rsbA and sigB constitute an operon (sigB operon). Transcripts were produced constitutively from a promoter (sigBp2) upstream of the rsbB coding region, contributing to the basal level expression of sigmaB protein. An inducible promoter (sigBp1) resembling the catB promoter (catBp) was located between the rsbA and sigB coding regions. Transcripts from sigBp1 dramatically increased as cells differentiated on solid media, at the stationary phase in liquid media or by osmotic stresses similar to the behaviour of catBp transcripts. Both catBp and sigBp1 promoters were recognized specifically by sigmaB-containing RNA polymerase in vitro. Disruption of the sigB gene abolished not only the differentiation-associated expression but also the osmotic induction of the catB gene, indicating that catBp is under the control of sigmaB. The sigB mutant exhibited a similar phenotype to the catB mutant, being sensitive to hyperosmolarity, blocked in forming aerial mycelium and with skewed antibiotic production. Therefore, we conclude that sigmaB ensures the proper differentiation and osmoprotection of S. coelicolor cells, primarily via regulation of the expression of catalase B.},

	abstract = {Whereas in Bacillus subtilis, a general stress response stimulon under the control of a single sigma factor (SigB) is induced by different physiological and environmental stresses (heat, salt or ethanol shock), in Streptomyces coelicolor, these environmental stresses induce independent sets of proteins, and its genome encodes nine SigB paralogues. To investigate possible functions of multiple sigB-like genes in S. coelicolor, Pctc, a promoter routinely used to assay SigB activity in vivo, was analysed as a heterologous reporter. The fact that Pctc was activated by osmotic shock, but not by heat or ethanol, confirmed that stress response system(s) could operate independently in S. coelicolor. Pctc was also induced transiently during growth of liquid cultures, presumably by nutritional signals. We purified an RNA polymerase holoenzyme from crude extracts that catalysed specific transcription of Pctc in vitro. Its sigma subunit was identified as a product of the sigH gene, which is co-transcribed downstream of a putative antisigma factor gene (prsH). Although the sigH function was not needed for normal colony morphology, prsH was conditionally required for both aerial hyphae formation and regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis. Levels of two different sigH-encoded proteins were growth phase dependent but not significantly changed by osmotic stress, implying the important roles of post-translational regulatory elements such as PrsH. In addition, synthesis of three other SigH-like proteins was induced by osmotic stress, but not by ethanol or heat. Two of them were genetically assigned to sigH homologous loci sigI and sigJ and shown to be independently regulated. This family of SigH-like proteins displayed different osmotic response kinetics. Thus, in contrast to many other bacteria, S. coelicolor uses an osmotic sensory system that can co-ordinate the activity of multiple paralogues to control the relative activity of promoters within the same stress stimulon. Such specialized stress response systems may reflect adaptive functions needed for colonial differentiation.},

In this organism, we have identified a new osmoregulation gene, osaC, encoding a member of a novel family of regulatory proteins. Members of the family have a predicted domain composition consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain related to anti-sigma factors, sensory Pas and Gaf domains, and a C-terminal phosphatase domain. osaC is linked to the response regulator gene osaB; expression analysis of the latter revealed that it is induced after osmotic stress in a sigma(B)-dependent manner. OsaC is required to return osaB and sigB expression back to constitutive levels after osmotic stress. From analysis of the activities of OsaC(DeltaPho), lacking the C-terminal phosphatase domain, and OsaC(N92A), with a substitution of a critical asparagine residue in the kinase domain, we infer that this N-terminal domain functions as a sigma(B) anti-sigma factor. Indeed, co-purification experiments indicate association of OsaC and sigma(B). These results support a model for post-osmotic stress modulation of sigma(B) activity by OsaC.},

	abstract = {In contrast to Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) contains nine homologues of stress response sigma factor SigB with a major role in differentiation and osmotic stress response. The aim of this study was to further characterize these SigB homologues. We previously established a two-plasmid system to identify promoters recognized by sigma factors and used it to identify promoters recognized by the three SigB homologues, SigF, SigG, and SigH from S. coelicolor A3(2). Here, we used this system to identify 14 promoters recognized by SigB. The promoters were verified in vivo in S. coelicolor A3(2) under osmotic stress conditions in sigB and sigH operon mutants, indicating some cross-recognition of these promoters by these two SigB homologues. This two-plasmid system was used to examine the recognition of all identified SigB-, SigF-, SigG-, and SigH-dependent promoters with all nine SigB homologues. The results confirmed this cross-recognition. Almost all 24 investigated promoters were recognized by two or more SigB homologues and data suggested some distinguishing groups of promoters recognized by these sigma factors. However, analysis of the promoters did not reveal any specific sequence characteristics for these recognition groups. All promoters showed high similarity in the -35 and -10 regions. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of SigB under osmotic stress conditions and SigH during morphological differentiation. Together with the phenotypic analysis of sigB and sigH operon mutants in S. coelicolor A3(2), the results suggest a dominant role for SigB in the osmotic stress response and a dual role for SigH in the osmotic stress response and morphological differentiation. These data suggest a complex regulation of the osmotic stress response in relation to morphological differentiation in S. coelicolor A3(2).},

	abstract = {Mycobacterial σB belongs to the group II family of sigma factors, which are widely considered to transcribe genes required for stationary-phase survival and the response to stress. Here we explored the mechanism underlying the observed hypersensitivity of ΔsigB deletion mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. abscessus, and M. tuberculosis to rifampin (RIF) and uncovered an additional constitutive role of σB during exponential growth of mycobacteria that complements the function of the primary sigma factor, σA Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we show that during exponential phase, σB binds to over 200 promoter regions, including those driving expression of essential housekeeping genes, like the rRNA gene. ChIP-Seq of ectopically expressed σA-FLAG demonstrated that at least 61 promoter sites are recognized by both σA and σB These results together suggest that RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing either σA or σB transcribe housekeeping genes in exponentially growing mycobacteria. The RIF sensitivity of the ΔsigB mutant possibly reflects a decrease in the effective housekeeping holoenzyme pool, which results in susceptibility of the mutant to lower doses of RIF. Consistent with this model, overexpression of σA restores the RIF tolerance of the ΔsigB mutant to that of the wild type, concomitantly ruling out a specialized role of σB in RIF tolerance. Although the properties of mycobacterial σB parallel those of Escherichia coli σ38 in its ability to transcribe a subset of housekeeping genes, σB presents a clear departure from the E. coli paradigm, wherein the cellular levels of σ38 are tightly controlled during exponential growth, such that the transcription of housekeeping genes is initiated exclusively by a holoenzyme containing σ70 (E.σ70).IMPORTANCE All mycobacteria encode a group II sigma factor, σB, closely related to the group I principal housekeeping sigma factor, σA Group II sigma factors are widely believed to play specialized roles in the general stress response and stationary-phase transition in the bacteria that encode them. Contrary to this widely accepted view, we show an additional housekeeping function of σB that complements the function of σA in logarithmically growing cells. These findings implicate a novel and dynamic partnership between σA and σB in maintaining the expression of housekeeping genes in mycobacteria and can perhaps be extended to other bacterial species that possess multiple group II sigma factors.},

We also demonstrate that ethambutol, a bacteriostatic drug, is highly bactericidal for M. tuberculosis mutants missing either SigE or SigB.

	abstract = {To characterize the roles of SigB and SigF in sigma factor regulation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we used chemically inducible recombinant strains to conditionally overexpress sigB and sigF. Using whole genomic microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we investigated the resulting global transcriptional changes after sigB induction, and we specifically tested the relative expression of other sigma factor genes after knock-in expression of sigB and sigF. Overexpression of sigB resulted in significant upregulation of genes encoding several early culture filtrate antigens (ESAT-6-like proteins), ribosomal proteins, PE-PGRS proteins, the keto-acyl synthase, KasA, and the regulatory proteins WhiB2 and IdeR. Of note, the induction of sigB did not alter the expression of other sigma factor genes, indicating that SigB is likely to serve as an end regulator for at least one branch of the M. tuberculosis sigma factor regulatory cascade. Analysis of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of SigB-dependent transcripts revealed a putative consensus sequence of NGTGG-N(14-18)-NNGNNG. This sequence appeared upstream of both sigB (Rv2710) and the gene following it, ideR (Rv2711), and in vitro transcription analysis with recombinant SigB-reconstituted RNA polymerase confirmed SigB-dependent transcription from each of these promoters. Knock-in expression of sigF revealed that only the sigC gene was significantly upregulated 6 and 12 h after sigF induction. The previously identified SigF promoter consensus sequence AGTTTG-N(15)-GGGTTT was identified in the 5' UTR of the sigC gene, and SigF-dependent in vitro transcription of the promoter upstream of sigC was confirmed by using recombinant SigF-reconstituted RNA polymerase. These two knock-in recombinant strains were tested in a macrophage model of infection which showed that overexpression of sigB and sigF resulted in reduced rates of M. tuberculosis intracellular growth. These results define the SigB promoter consensus recognition sequence and members of the SigB regulon. Moreover, the data suggest that, in addition to serving as an end regulator in a sigma factor cascade, SigB may auto-amplify its own expression under certain conditions.},

	abstract = {The sigA and sigB genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis encode two sigma 70-like sigma factors of RNA polymerase. While transcription of the sigA gene is growth rate independent, sigB transcription is increased during entry into stationary phase. The sigA gene transcription is unresponsive to environmental stress but that of sigB is very responsive, more so in stationary-phase growth than in log-phase cultures. These data suggest that SigA is a primary sigma factor which, like sigma70, controls the transcription of the housekeeping type of promoters. In contrast, SigB, although showing some overlap in function with SigA, is more like the alternative sigma factor, sigmaS, which controls the transcription of the gearbox type of promoters. Primer extension analysis identified the RNA start sites for both genes as 129 nucleotides upstream to the GTG start codon of sigA and 27 nucleotides from the ATG start codon of sigB. The -10 promoter of sigA but not that of sigB was similar to the sigma70 promoter. The half-life of the sigA transcript was very long, and this is likely to play an important part in its regulation. In contrast, the half-life of the sigB transcript was short, about 2 min. These results demonstrate that the sigB gene may control the regulons of stationary phase and general stress resistance, while sigA may be involved in the housekeeping regulons.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen that can be a commensal but also cause a wide range of different infections. This broad disease spectrum is a reflection of the complex regulation of a large collection of virulence factors that together with metabolic fitness allow adaptation to different niches. The alternative sigma factor SigB is one of the global regulators mediating this adaptation. However, even if SigB contributes to expression of many virulence factors its importance for successful infection greatly varies with the strain and the infection setting analyzed. We have recently established a proteomics workflow that combines high efficiency cell sorting with sensitive mass spectrometry and allows monitoring of global proteome adaptations with roughly one million bacterial cells. Thus, we can now approach the adaptation of pathogens to the intracellular milieu. In the current study this proteomics workflow was used in conjunction with qRT-PCR and confocal fluorescence microscopy to comparatively analyze the adaptation of the S. aureus wild type strain HG001 and its isogenic sigB mutant to the intracellular milieu of human S9 bronchial epithelial cells. The study revealed fast and transient activation of SigB following internalization by human host cells and the requirement of SigB for intracellular growth. Loss of SigB triggered proteome changes reflecting the different residual growth rates of wild type and sigB mutant, respectively, the resistance to methicillin, adaptation to oxidative stress and protein quality control mechanisms.},

	abstract = {SigB is an alternative sigma factor that controls a large regulon in Staphylococcus aureus. Activation of SigB requires RsbU, a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C)-type phosphatase. In a closely related organism, Bacillus subtilis, RsbU activity is stimulated upon interaction with RsbT, a kinase, which following an activating stimulus switches from a 25S high-molecular-weight complex, the stressosome, to the N-terminal domain of RsbU. Active RsbU dephosporylates RsbV and thereby triggers the release of SigB from its inhibitory complex with RsbW. While RsbU, RsbV, RsbW, and SigB are conserved in S. aureus, proteins similar to RsbT and the components of the stressosome are not, raising the question of how RsbU activity and hence SigB activity are controlled in S. aureus. We found that in contrast to the case in B. subtilis, the induced expression of RsbU was sufficient to stimulate SigB-dependent transcription in S. aureus. However, activation of SigB-dependent transcription following alkaline stress did not lead to a clear accumulation of SigB and its regulators RsbV and RsbW or to a change in the RsbV/RsbV-P ratio in S. aureus. When expressed in B. subtilis, the S. aureus RsbU displayed a high activity even in the absence of an inducing stimulus. This high activity could be transferred to the PP2C domain of the B. subtilis RsbU protein by a fusion to the N-terminal domain of the S. aureus RsbU. Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of the S. aureus RsbU and hence SigB may be subjected to different regulation in comparison to that in B. subtilis.},

However, of the proteins controlling the activity of sigmaB in B. subtilis only RsbU, RsbV, and RsbW are encoded in the staphylococcal genome. Therefore, the regulation of the sigmaB activity must differ between these two bacterial species. The present study was designed (i) to describe the sigmaB regulon and (ii) to identify stimuli leading to an activation of sigmaB-dependent transcription. All conditions under which sigmaB was activated in S. aureus (heat shock, addition of MnCl2 or NaCl, alkaline shock) required the presence of RsbU, a positive regulator of sigmaB. In contrast to B. subtilis, a drop in the cellular ATP level caused by the addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not lead to an activation of sigmaB in S. aureus. Moreover, ethanol, a strong inductor of sigmaB activity in B. subtilis, also failed to induce sigmaB in S. aureus. Expression of sigB and sigmaB-dependent genes was enhanced following entry into stationary phase of cells grown in complex medium (LB medium). Our DNA microarray data indicated that 122 genes are positively regulated by sigmaB under alkaline stress conditions. Interestingly, only 12\% of these genes have an orthologue in the B. subtilis sigmaB regulon, suggesting that the function of the sigmaB regulon in S. aureus is different from that in B. subtilis. We could show that sigmaB of S. aureus, in contrast to B. subtilis, may have a function in more basic cellular processes such as cell envelope composition, membrane transport processes and intermediary metabolism. sigmaB-dependent genes identified by the DNA microarray approach were subjected to detailed transcriptional analyses using primer extension and Northern blot techniques. These analyses confirmed our DNA microarray data and furthermore revealed different regulatory groups of sigmaB-dependent genes.},

The two-dimensional protein pattern of wild-type cells of S. aureus COL was compared with that of an isogenic sigB mutant. By this approach, we found that the synthesis of about 27 cytoplasmic proteins seemed to be under the positive control of sigma(B). N-terminal sequencing of 18 proteins allowed the identification of their genes on the almost finished genome sequence of S. aureus COL and the analysis of the promoter structure. Transcriptional analyses of 11 of these genes confirmed their sigma(B) dependency, and moreover, about 7 additional sigma(B)-dependent genes were found which are cotranscribed with the newly detected genes, forming operons. Altogether, we identified 23 sigma(B)-dependent genes and their corresponding proteins. Among them are proteins probably involved in the generation of NADH or in membrane transport mechanisms. Furthermore, at least one clpC-homologous gene was localized on the S. aureus sequence solely transcribed by sigma(B). In contrast, a second clpC-homologous gene in S. aureus forming an operon with ctsR, yacH, and yacI was sigma(B) independently expressed.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen that is tolerant to many of the stresses commonly used during food preservation. Outside the host, the bacterium has a saprophytic lifestyle that includes periodic exposure to solar irradiance. The blue component of this light is known to influence the activity of the stress-inducible sigma factor Sigma B (σB). In this study, the influence of temperature and growth phase on the response of L. monocytogenes to blue light was investigated and the global transcriptional response to blue light was elucidated using an RNAseq-based approach. Stationary phase cells were found to be significantly more resistant to killing by blue light (470 nm) than exponential phase cells. Temperature also had a marked effect on blue light resistance with cells cultured at 37°C being much more sensitive than cells grown at 30°C. The role of σB in light tolerance was confirmed but this effect was observed only at 30°C. σB activation by blue light was assessed by measuring the transcriptional response of known σB-dependent genes (sigB, lmo2230, and opuCA) to light. The transcripts were induced by blue light only at 30°C suggesting that blue light fails to activate σB at 37°C. The light-induced transcription at 30°C was dependent on a functional blue light sensor, Lmo0799 (which we rename herein as RsbL). A transcriptomic analysis of the response to sub-lethal levels of blue light found that the changes in transcription were almost entirely σB-dependent. A mutant where the light sensing mechanism of RsbL was inactivated through an amino acid substitution (Cys56Ala) was found to have an attenuated response to blue light, but residual activation of σB-dependent genes suggested that alternative routes for activation of σB by light are likely to exist. Overall, the study highlights the central role of σB in the response of this pathogen to visible light and further shows that light sensing is absent at temperatures that exist within the mammalian host.},

While we have a comparatively good understanding of the systems under the control of this sigma factor much less is known about how the activity of σB is controlled. In this review, we present a current model describing how this sigma factor is thought to be controlled including an overview of what is known about stress sensing and the early signal transduction events that trigger its activation. We discuss the known regulatory overlaps between σB and other protein and RNA regulators in the cell. Finally, we describe the role of σB in surviving both saprophytic and host-associated stresses. The complexity of the regulation of this sigma factor reflects the significant role that it plays in the persistence of this important pathogen in the natural environment, the food chain as well as within the host during the early stages of an infection. Understanding its regulation will be a critical step in helping to develop rational strategies to prevent its growth and survival in the food destined for human consumption and in the prevention of listeriosis.},

	abstract = {Anisakiasis is a gastrointestinal disease caused by parasitic anisakid nematodes, mainly Anisakis simplex sensu stricto (A. simplex). Anisakiasis is prevalent in Japan and approximately 40\% of anisakiasis cases in Tokyo occur through the consumption of raw or marinated mackerel. However, in 2018, there was a sudden increase in the number of the food poisoning cases in Tokyo caused by consumption of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). Therefore, we investigated anisakiasis cases resulting from ingestion of skipjack tuna in Tokyo, and surveyed the presence of Anisakis larvae in skipjack tuna in 2018 and 2019. Nineteen samples from 15 patients (13 in 2018 and 2 in 2019) with anisakiasis surely caused by ingestion of skipjack tuna were all identified as A. simplex. The higher mean abundance of Anisakis simplex larvae in skipjack tuna muscle in May 2018 (1.30; 13 larvae/10 fishes) compared to that in the other periods was regarded as a contributing factor in the increase in anisakiasis cases by ingesting skipjack tuna in 2018. To verify whether Anisakis larvae migrate from the visceral organs to the muscle during the period from fishing on the boat until processing for sale, the number of Anisakis larvae in skipjack tuna caught from August to November 2018 was investigated by removing the visceral organs at three different timings, i.e., immediately after catching, after landing, and after transport to the laboratory. Anisakis larvae were detected in the muscle irrespective of the timings at which visceral organs were removed. All larvae from the muscle were detected only from the ventral part and were identified as A. simplex. We thus consider that avoiding raw consumption of the ventral muscle should be an effective measure to prevent anisakiasis.},

Two events impacted 2020 MS data collection and related statistics: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2020, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) from 2016 to 2020. Fourteen of the 26 MS reporting data on Salmonella control programmes in poultry met the reduction targets for all poultry categories. Salmonella results for carcases of various species performed by competent authorities were more frequently positive than own-checks conducted by food business operators. This was also the case for Campylobacter quantification results from broiler carcases for the MS group that submitted data from both samplers, whereas overall at EU level, those percentages were comparable. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, with 10-fold less cases reported than salmonellosis, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. Illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases with the highest case fatality. In 2020, 27 MS reported 3,086 foodborne outbreaks (a 47.0\% decrease from 2019) and 20,017 human cases (a 61.3\% decrease). Salmonella remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in ‘eggs and egg products’, norovirus in ‘crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and products containing them’ and L. monocytogenes in ‘fish and fish products’ were the agent/food pairs of most concern.

	abstract = {This mini review focuses on foodborne illnesses and outbreaks caused by
food-producing animals because statistical information of the foodborne
illnesses is important in human health and food industry. Contaminated food
results in 600 million cases of foodborne diseases and 420,000 deaths worldwide
every year. The world population is currently 7.8 billion, and 56 million people
die every year; of these, every year, 7.69\% of people experience
foodborne diseases, and 7.5\% of annual deaths (56 million deaths) was
died by foodborne illness in the world. A majority of such patients are affected
by norovirus and Campylobacter. Listeria
monocytogenes is the most fatal. In the United States, except for
those caused by Campylobacter, the number of foodborne diseases
did not decrease between 1997 and 2017, and cases caused by Toxoplasma
gondii are still being reported (9 cases in 2017). The percentage
of foodborne illnesses caused by food-producing animals was
10.4\%–14.1\% between 1999 and 2017 in the United States. In
Europe, foodborne illnesses affect 23 million people every year and cause
approximately 5,000 deaths. Europe has more Campylobacter- and
Salmonella-related cases than in other countries. In
Australia, the highest number of cases are due to
Campylobacter, followed by Salmonella. In
Korea, Escherichia coli followed by norovirus.
Campylobacter- and Clostridium
perfringens-related cases have been reported in Japan as well. This
review suggests that Campylobacter,
Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and E.
coli, which are usually isolated from animal-source food products
are associated with a high risk of foodborne illnesses.},

	abstract = {In a time of increasing threats and decreasing financial resources, monitoring and controlling all possible foodborne hazards at the same time and to the same extent has become more challenging than ever. Therefore, attention is increasingly being paid to the so-called “risk ranking” methods that enable decision makers to focus on the most important foodborne hazards — even when time is limited and knowledge incomplete. In this review paper, we provide an overview of the most common quantitative methods and metrics used for ranking the risks associated with foodborne parasites and present the state of the art on risk ranking exercises for foodborne parasites. A number of risk ranking metrics and methods are available, ranging from simple approaches that can be used to assess the health or economic impact of a foodborne parasitic disease, to more complicated but more comprehensive multi-criteria assessments. For health impact assessment, measures of population health such as disease occurrence and number of deaths; Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) measuring the healthy life years lost; and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) measuring the number of life years lived in optimal health, are described. For economic impact assessment, applied approaches that measure the cost-of-illness from a societal perspective and stated preference methods are outlined. Finally, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which can be used to integrate multiple metrics and criteria into a single ranking, is described. These risk ranking methods for foodborne parasites are increasingly performed to aid priority setting at global, regional, and national levels. As different stakeholders have their own prioritization objectives and beliefs, the outcome of such exercises is necessarily context-dependent. Therefore, when designing a risk ranking exercise for foodborne parasites, it is important to choose the metrics and methods, as well as what to rank, in the light of the predefined context of the question being addressed and the target audience.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of molecular subtyping information are generated by the private sector, academia, and government agencies. However, use of subtype data is limited by a lack of effective data storage and sharing mechanisms that allow comparison of subtype data from multiple sources. Currently available subtype databases are generally limited in scope to a few data types (e.g., MLST.net) or are not publicly available (e.g., PulseNet). We describe the development and initial implementation of Food Microbe Tracker, a public Web-based database that allows archiving and exchange of a variety of molecular subtype data that can be cross-referenced with isolate source data, genetic data, and phenotypic characteristics. Data can be queried with a variety of search criteria, including DNA sequences and banding pattern data (e.g., ribotype or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type). Food Microbe Tracker allows the deposition of data on any bacterial genus and species, bacteriophages, and other viruses. The bacterial genera and species that currently have the most entries in this database are Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., and Paenibacillus spp., with over 40,000 isolates. The combination of pathogen and spoilage microorganism data in the database will facilitate source tracking and outbreak detection, improve discovery of emerging subtypes, and increase our understanding of transmission and ecology of these microbes. Continued addition of subtyping, genetic or phenotypic data for a variety of microbial species will broaden the database and facilitate large-scale studies on the diversity of food-associated microbes.},

We analyzed risk factors for sporadic giardiasis by a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature. From 72 studies, contact with an infected person, lack of personal hygiene, and attending a child daycare center were identified as risk factors in children and adults. Feco-oral transmission was significantly associated with exposure to human sewage/waste water, untreated drinking water and recreational waters. Travel abroad was a risk factor in industrialized countries. No handwashing before eating or preparing food, eating unwashed vegetables, or composite food were significant risk factors. Breastfeeding was a protective factor in developing countries. Interestingly, contact with pets was found as a significant risk factor in children in this meta-analysis. This could be explored in future studies with the comparison of the Giardia assemblage isolated from humans and pets. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate more precisely the type of water, vegetable, and whenever possible the method of preparation/treatment. Environmental and epidemiological investigations of specific risk factors by assemblages and types of Giardia spp. should be further studied. Finally, host factors in relationship with the severity and sequelae of giardiasis deserve future research.},

Information on the sources and transmission pathways of human cryptosporidiosis results mainly from outbreak investigations. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies were performed to determine the main risk factors associated with sporadic cryptosporidiosis. Suitable scientific articles were identified through a systematic literature search and subjected to a methodological quality assessment. From each study, odds ratio (OR) measures were extracted or calculated, as well as study characteristics such as population type, design, type of model and risk factor hierarchy. Mixed-effects meta-analysis models were adjusted by population type to appropriate data partitions. From 1985 identified references, the quality assessment stage was passed by 57 cohort and case-control studies focusing on sporadic cryptosporidiosis. The eligible studies were conducted between 1983 and 2016 and provided 568 OR categorized for meta-analysis. This meta-analysis identified travel, immunocompromising conditions, contact with infected humans, waterborne transmission (contact with recreational waters, wastewater, and consumption of untreated drinking water), contact with animals and food consumption as the relevant risk factors for sporadic cryptosporidiosis. With regards to food exposures, consumption of meat, dairy products (raw milk) and dishes consumed outside home were found significantly associated with cryptosporidiosis. The consumption of poorly washed fruits and vegetables significantly increases ORs. This meta-analysis reveals that some potential sources of Cryptosporidium such as shellfish or vegetables are under-investigated. Future case-control studies for sporadic cryptosporidiosis should include population at risk, and investigate other potential sources in relation to the genotype and the subtype of Cryptosporidium spp.},

	abstract = {Norovirus is responsible for 20\% of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. The fecal-oral route of transmission is known, but we proposed a first attempt to identify the relative importance of different sources and vehicles for sporadic cases using meta-analysis models. Case-control and cohort/cross-sectional studies were systematically reviewed and analyzed to assess the main risk factors associated with sporadic norovirus infections. Suitable scientific articles were identified through systematic literature search and subjected to a methodological quality assessment. Mixed-effects meta-analyses models were adjusted by population type to appropriate risk factor categories. The quality assessment stage led to include 14 primary studies conducted between 1993 and 2014. From these, eight studies investigated exposures in children/infants, and eight concerned the mixed population. The meta-analysis confirmed the oro-fecal route for norovirus infections, with the person-to-person transmission (pooled OR=3.002; 95\% CI: [2.502-3.062] in mixed population), and the lack of personal hygiene (pooled OR=2.329; 95\% CI: [1.049-5.169]). The meta-analysis also enlightened the role of indirect transmission through the environment with pathways like untreated drinking water (mixed population), with a pooled OR=2.680 (95\% CI: [1.081-6.643]) and farm environment (children population). Indirect transmission also involved the food pathway, which was finally found significant with consumption of seafood (mixed population) (pooled OR=2.270; 95\% CI: [1.299-3.968]) and composite food (eating outside/uncooked mixed and young population) (pooled OR=4.541; 95\% CI: [3.461-5.958]). These results are coherent with the findings from studies on outbreaks. However, a too broad definition of exposure factors limited the interpretation of results, as occurred with the seafood pathways that combined fish and shellfish. Other factors such as consumption of Food-handled products or the type of drinking water deserveE to be better investigated. Furthermore, better harmonization in case definition and appropriate case-control or cross-sectional studies would allow better addressing sporadic cases risk factors, especially for susceptible populations, such as children, elderly or immunosuppressed persons.},

The parasitic cycle is mostly known, but the relative contribution of different sources and pathways of transmission was not previously studied by a meta-analysis. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies were performed to determine the main risk factors associated with sporadic Toxoplasma infection. Suitable scientific articles were identified through a systematic literature search and subjected to a methodological quality assessment. Mixed-effects meta-analysis models were adjusted by population type – children, mixed population, and pregnant women – to appropriate data partitions. 187 primary studies passed the quality assessment stage, investigating risk factors for sporadic infection with Toxoplasma gondii conducted between 1983 and 2016. Cases were defined by serology. The meta-analysis of Toxoplasma sporadic infections revealed the significance of transmission by environmental factors such as contact with soil and contact with animals, in particular cats. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat and unwashed vegetables significantly increased the odds of acquiring the disease. Shellfish and raw milk were identified as significant sources of toxoplasmosis. Almost all meat categories were identified as risk factors: pork, poultry, beef, processed meat, lamb, and game meat. Contaminated drinking water may play a role in the acquisition of infection. Moreover, the lack of hygiene in preparing food was identified as a risk factor. A significant risk factor for pregnant women is traveling abroad. Lastly, blood transfusion (in pregnant women) and immunocompromised conditions were found associated with positive serology. The broad definition of exposures and the use of serology for the case definition are the main limitations for the interpretation of the results of this meta-analysis. The transmission pathways require further investigations using longitudinal studies and subtyping approaches.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the main causes of viral hepatitis infection worldwide. Sources of contamination can vary greatly according to geographical regions and HEV genotypes. HEV is endemic and responsible for large waterborne epidemics involving human HEV-1 or HEV-2 genotypes in regions with limited sanitation, in contrast to industrialized countries, where HEV is mainly a foodborne zoonosis involving HEV-3 and HEV-4 zoonotic genotypes. Limited data on HEV source attribution are available, and all possible sources and transmission pathways of HEV are not fully identified. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies (including transversal studies) were performed to determine the main risk factors associated with sporadic hepatitis E infection. Suitable scientific articles were identified through a systematic literature search and subjected to a methodological quality assessment. From each study, odds-ratio (OR) measures were extracted/calculated, as well as study characteristics such as population type, design, and risk factor hierarchy. Mixed-effects meta-analyses models were adjusted by population type to appropriate data partitions. Seventy-seven cohort and case-control studies conducted between 1986 and 2016 and investigating risk factors in mixed population, susceptible population, and pregnant women, were included in this meta-analysis. Hepatitis E cases were defined with serological exams and differentiated whenever the serological exam is associated or not with symptoms. This meta-analysis identified the parenteral pathway (blood transfusion, tattooing or IV injection, dialysis or hemodialysis), and routes of infection related to contaminated water, animal contact (occupational exposure) and consumption of foods as relevant risk factors for hepatitis E infection. With regards to the role of food, as suspected and sometimes proven in several studies, pig meat, pork sausages, and game meat are identified as significant risk factors for HEV, in particular undercooked pig meat, or meat preparations containing pig liver. In addition, consumption of shellfish (oysters and mussels), in which HEV can accumulate when water is environmentally contaminated (from animal or human origin), is also associated with the detection of anti-HEV antibodies. The results of this meta-analysis show that symptomatic and infected cases share the most explainable risk factors, and are in agreement with recent studies conducted in Europe. This meta-analysis reveals that some sources such as consumption of insufficiently treated water, shellfish, or vegetables are under-investigated. Future case-control studies should include population at risk but under-investigated, such as transplant recipients, pregnant women and children, and investigate other potential sources of HEV.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies were performed to determine the main risk factors associated with sporadic Y. enterocolitica infections. Suitable scientific articles published between 1987 and 2017 were identified through a systematic literature search and subject to methodological quality assessment.

Mixed-effects meta-analytical models were adjusted by population type to appropriate data partitions. From 807 identified references, the quality assessment stage was passed by 14 case-control studies focusing on sporadic Y. enterocolitica infections which provided 165 ORs for meta-analysis. All studies considered Y. enterocolitica as the cause of sporadic infections and are mainly located in Europe. The meta-analysis identified host-specifics factors, animal and food exposures as significant risk factors. The meta-analysis confirms the predominant role of the pig reservoir. The occupational contact with pigs and the consumption of pork meat are significantly associated with sporadic Y. enterocolitica infections occurrence. The consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat is also a very important risk factor. Untreated drinking water was also identified as risk factor. Further studies with other enteropathogenic Yersinia species, especially Y. pseudotuberculosis, and/or from other continents would help to refine conclusions of the meta-analysis of the risk factors of yersiniosis.},

	abstract = {In order to design effective public health strategies, and, in particular, effective food safety interventions to reduce the burden of foodborne disease, the most important sources of enteric illnesses should be identified. Both case-control and cohort observational studies have for long been powerful approaches among epidemiologists to investigate the association of exposure and illness. In the literature, there are numerous case-control and cohort studies reporting results on risk factors and routes of transmission of sporadic foodborne infections. The objective of this article is to describe, in depth, the strategies implemented for systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between multiple risk factors and eleven food and waterborne diseases, namely, non-typhoidal salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, Shiga-toxin E. coli infection, listeriosis, yersiniosis, toxoplasmosis, norovirus infection, hepatitis A, hepatitis E, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. First, this article describes the procedures of systematic searches in five bibliographic engines, screening of relevance and assessment of methodological quality according to pre-set criteria. It proceeds with the explanation of a broad data categorisation scheme established to hierarchically group the risk factors into travel, host-specific factors and pathways of exposure (i.e., person-to-person, animal, environment and food routes), with views to harmonising and supporting the integration of outcomes from studies investigating a variety of potential determinants of disease. Next, the article describes the four meta-analysis models that were devised in order to calculate: (i) overall odds-ratios of acquiring the disease due to a specific risk factor by geographical region; (ii) overall odds-ratios of acquiring the disease from the different risk factors; (iii) overall risks of disease from consumption of ready-to-eat and barbecued foods; and (iv) overall effects of food handling (i.e., consuming food in raw, undercooked or unwashed state) and food preparation setting (i.e., eating food prepared outside the home) on risk of disease. The procedures for sensitivity analysis and removal of any influential and potentially-biased odds-ratio; and two methods for publication bias assessment are outlined. Finally, details are given on deviations from the standard risk categorisation scheme for specific foodborne hazards.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is responsible for common acute viral hepatitis worldwide. Improvement in sanitation and use of efficient vaccines have reduced HAV incidence in developed countries. However, naive adult population are most susceptible to severe outcomes, and high endemic areas persist in developing regions. The transmission of HAV through the fecal-oral route is established. However, considering evolving consumption habits and global market exchange of food, investigations on risk factors associated with HAV infection are needed. Thus, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of case-control, cohort and transversal studies was performed to determine the main risk factors associated with sporadic HAV infection. Relevant scientific articles were identified through systematic literature search and subjected to a methodological quality assessment. Mixed-effects meta-analyses models were adjusted by population type to appropriate data partitions. HAV infections are defined by serological testing. The quality assessment stage selected 78 studies investigating risk factors for sporadic infections with hepatitis A conducted between 1985 and 2013. This meta-analysis confirmed that HAV infections are mostly related to inter-human transmissions, either due to contact with an ill person, through oral-anal sex practice, or lack of personal hygiene. Travel to endemic countries, occupational exposure such as working in child daycare, and exposure to wastewater were associated with HAV infection. As HAV can persist in the environment, it was not surprising that consumption of untreated drinking water, shellfish consumed raw, and crop products were risk factors. Food contamination could be due to the use of contaminated water (fruits, vegetables) or originate from infected food handlers at every point of the food chain (from picking to serving). Eating or drinking outside were associated with HAV infection. A lack of recent case-control studies was identified, with only three studies eligible between 2011 and 2017. Case-control studies required a more precise definition of risk factors such as type of crop product, and storing/preparation information (e.g. washed, frozen). The frequency of consumption or duration of environmental exposure could also better inform relationship between exposure and risk of infection. In a context of epidemiological change of HAV, international travel and trade of foods, future case-control studies are needed and should focus on populations at risk of severe infections and acute cases.},

source of food poisoning in Deptsang village for implementing prevention and control measures.
, 
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study for the outbreak investigation. Stool specimens
were collected from cases to perform culture and antibiogram. The team also inspected the
environment and hygiene practices in both the construction site and the entire community. The
association between the exposure to carcass meat and their outcome of acute gastroenteritis was
assessed by risk ratio. P{\textless}0.05 was considered statistically significant.
, 
Results: Fifty-five villagers consumed the carcass meat during lunch and dinner resulting in 33 cases.
Multi-drug resistant Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated from stool specimens of cases, which were
susceptible to chloramphenicol only. A risk ratio of 2.1 was found between those people who
consumed the carcass meat and those who did not consume the carcass meat (P{\textless}0.001).
, 
Conclusions: The current outbreak of food poisoning was caused by the consumption of carcass
meat contaminated with A. hydrophila. Provision of health education with emphasis on food hygiene is
needed in remote areas to prevent such outbreaks in the future.},

	abstract = {An estimated 4.0–6.9 million episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis occur in Australia each year., We estimated for Australia the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to foodborne gastroenteritis in a typical year, circa 2000. The total amount of infectious gastroenteritis was measured by using a national telephone survey. The foodborne proportion was estimated from Australian data on each of 16 pathogens. To account for uncertainty, we used simulation techniques to calculate 95\% credibility intervals (CrI). The estimate of incidence of gastroenteritis in Australia is 17.2 million (95\% confidence interval 14.5–19.9 million) cases per year. We estimate that 32\% (95\% CrI 24\%–40\%) are foodborne, which equals 0.3 (95\% CrI 0.2–0.4) episodes per person, or 5.4 million (95\% CrI 4.0–6.9 million) cases annually in Australia. Norovirus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. cause the most illnesses. In addition, foodborne gastroenteritis causes ≈15,000 (95\% CrI 11,000–18,000) hospitalizations and 80 (95\% CrI 40–120) deaths annually. This study highlights global public health concerns about foodborne diseases and the need for standardized methods, including assessment of uncertainty, for international comparison.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the overall human health impact of agents transmitted commonly through food complement surveillance and help guide food safety interventions and regulatory initiatives. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the methods and reporting practices used in studies that estimate the total number of illnesses caused by these agents. We identified and included 43 studies published from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2019, by searching PubMed and screening selected articles for other relevant publications. Selected articles presented original estimates of the number of illnesses caused by ≥1 agent transmitted commonly through food. The number of agents (species or subspecies for pathogens) included in each study ranged from 1 to 31 (median: 4.5; mean: 9.2). Of the 40 agents assessed across the 43 studies, the most common agent was Salmonella (36; 84\% of studies), followed by Campylobacter (33; 77\%), Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (25; 58\%), and norovirus (20; 47\%). Investigators used a variety of data sources and methods that could be grouped into four distinct estimation approaches—direct, surveillance data scaled-up, syndrome or population scaled-down, and inferred. Based on our review, we propose four recommendations to improve the interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility of studies that estimate the number of illnesses caused by agents transmitted commonly through food. These include providing an assessment of statistical and nonstatistical uncertainty, providing a ranking of estimates by agent, including uncertainties; describing the rationale used to select agents and data sources; and publishing raw data and models, along with clear, detailed methods. These recommendations could lead to better decision-making about food safety policies. Although these recommendations have been made in the context of illness estimation for agents transmitted commonly through food, they also apply to estimates of other health outcomes and conditions.},

	abstract = {Background.  The risk of infection with Anisakis has been recognized for some time, but it is now emerging due to major awareness, better diagnostic techniques, and increasing preference for raw or lightly cooked food. Spain has the second-highest reported incidence after Japan, though the real anisakidosis burden is unknown because of the scarcity of epidemiological data. This study provides a 19-year review of anisakidosis-related hospitalizations describing epidemiological trends and patient characteristics.
Methods.  We performed a retrospective descriptive study using the Spanish Hospitalization Minimum Data Set from 1997 to 2015. Hospitalization rates were calculated and spatial distribution of cases and their temporal behavior were assessed. Clinical characteristics were described, including related codiagnoses and procedures.
Results.  A total of 2471 hospital discharges were identified. A continuous increasing trend was observed, with several peaks. Most affected communities were located in the northwest inland part of the country. Almost 54\% of hospitalized patients were male, with a mean age of 51.3 years. Median length of stay was 5 days, and the hospitalization median cost around €2900. Fatal outcome occurred in 0.5\%. Most frequent codiagnoses were digestive diseases, mainly intestinal obstruction. Urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, and angioneurotic edema were only recorded in 2.2\%, 2.4\%, and 1.2\%, respectively.
Conclusions.  Knowing that hospitalization is unusual in anisakidosis, we offer calculations of the real disease burden. Improving disease surveillance in parallel to disease control will be useful both in gaining extended disease knowledge and reducing morbidity and related costs.},

Spain appears to have the highest reported incidence in Europe and marinated anchovies are recognised as the main food vehicle. Using data on fishery landings, fish infection rates and consumption habits of the Spanish population from questionnaires, we developed a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) model for the anchovy value chain. Spaniards were estimated to consume on average 0.66 Anisakis per untreated (non-frozen) raw or marinated anchovy meal. A dose-response relationship was generated and the probability of anisakiasis was calculated to be 9.56 × 10−5 per meal, and the number of annual anisakiasis cases requiring medical attention was predicted between 7,700 and 8,320. Monte Carlo simulations estimated post-mortem migration of Anisakis from viscera to flesh increases the disease burden by {\textgreater}1000\% whilst an education campaign to freeze anchovy before consumption may reduce cases by 80\%. However, most of the questionnaire respondents who ate untreated meals knew how to prevent Anisakis infection. The QRA suggests that previously reported figures of 500 anisakiasis per year in Europe is a considerable underestimate. The QRA tool can be used by policy makers and informs industry, health professionals and consumers about this underdiagnosed zoonosis.},

Relative risks associated with this organism in powdered infant formula (PIF) have been described in several studies. To set priorities and decide on risk management options, it is important for risk managers to have a quantitative perspective on the absolute level of risk of this pathogen within the totality of the burden of illnesses in the population. This study set-out to establish such a perspective for The Netherlands. It addresses the impact of heterogeneity in the distribution of the micro-organism in PIF on risk levels. Based on the assumptions in this study, 60\% of formula-fed infants are estimated not to be exposed to Cronobacter spp. during their neonatal period. The mean exposure was calculated to be about 1cfu per infant over the total neonatal period. Even after thorough mixing, artificially contaminated powder shows counts which are more variable than expected from a normal, homogeneous distribution. Therefore, mean exposure levels may not represent a good basis for calculating risks. The burden of disease of Cronobacter infections to the Dutch population was estimated to be 19-24 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per year, of which 95\% are due to meningitis. As compared to other illnesses Cronobacter infections represent 0.5-2.4\% of the total estimated burden of foodborne infections and intoxications. The organism is estimated to be responsible for 0.5-0.7\% of the meningitis burden to the entire population of The Netherlands.},

	abstract = {The RIVM analyses how many years are lost on average due to ill health or death (disease burden) as a result of gastrointestinal infections. The 14 pathogens causing these infections are primarily foodborne (60\%). People can also come into contact with these pathogens via the environment, for example via surface water, animals, or other people. The burden of disease from these 14 pathogens was much lower in 2020 than in 2019. This is most probably due to the measures implemented in the Netherlands since March 2020 aimed at stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2-virus. Examples of such measures include the closure of restaurants and cafés, a ban on face-to-face meetings, restrictions on international travel, and an increased focus on hygiene, including hand washing. In addition, fewer people might have sought or received medical help for these illnesses, which require a laboratory diagnosis, among other things, to be registered. An international unit of measure is used to quantify the disease burden, namely Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The estimated disease burden via food in 2020 was 3,600 DALYs, with a decrease of 22\% compared to 2019 (4,600 DALYs). For all the 14 pathogens combined, the total number of DALYs in 2020 was approximately 7,300. That is 34\% less than the corresponding figure for 2019, 2018, and 2017 (approximately 11,000 DALYs per year). The total cost of this disease burden in 2020 was estimated at 282 million euros, which was much less than in 2019 (423 million euros) and 2018 (426 million euros). The estimated cost includes the direct medical costs, for example in hospitals, as well as the costs incurred by the patients and families, such as travelling expenses. It also includes the costs incurred in other sectors, for example as a result of work absenteeism. The costs resulting from contaminated food also decreased significantly: 153 million euros in 2020 compared to 181 million euros in 2019 and 178 million euros in 2018. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport commissioned this research. The results provide policymakers with insight into the disease burden and the various ways in which people can acquire an infection with food-related pathogens. This research also allows to monitor possible trends in time of the disease burden from foodborne infections, as well as of the associated costs.},

The purpose of this paper is to critique the existing and emerging alternative approaches being used by regulators and industry to verify the presence and efficacy of food safety management systems (FSMS). It is the second paper in a theme issue of Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes, discussing the importance of measuring food safety and quality culture.
This paper, primarily focused on UK examples, examines academic and grey literature to consider the options for effective verification of FSMS with emphasis on the hospitality sector including the use of triangulation.
Third-party certification (TPC) compliance audits alone will not deliver effective verification of the FSMS and the cultural context of how formal systems are implemented, monitored and internally verified. Triangulation needs to be undertaken during the FSMS verification process which at its simplest is a Question, Observe, Measure (QOM) triad and at its more complex involves TPC compliance audits and performance assessment using data analysis methodology and product and environmental testing.
The paper will be of value to practitioners, researchers and other stakeholders involved in the hospitality industry.},

	isbn = {978-1-61470-008-1},
	abstract = {Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) has been the foremost food safety management system for many years, providing a systematic, cost-effective and efficacious approach for risk management and prevention. HACCP allows food manufacturers to identify hazards and measures for their control, and determine critical control points. Risk assessment, however, is a more recent scientifically-based development, comprising 4 elements that are hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization. Whilst there are common elements in these two procedures, such as hazard identification, they were developed for very different purposes and are complementary to one another. The Food Safety Objective, which is still a concept, but an important metric in risk assessment, provides a functional link between risk assessment and risk management, where HACCP is the key tool. Even though HACCP and risk assessment differ fundamentally, with risk assessment traditionally focusing on single pathogen-food combinations, and HACCP taking account of multiple hazards for a single product in a particular manufacturing facility, each can significantly contribute to the other. Risk mitigation measures at the population level, a key objective of risk assessment, can be likened to the principle activities of HACCP. This chapter describes the components of HACCP and risk assessment and considers these in the context of risks posed by protozoan parasites, including Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis. While these agents are commonly regarded as waterborne pathogens, outbreaks of illness caused by these organisms also occur via foods and these have been increasing in recent years, with the majority of these linked to fresh produce. The information available for these hazards is comparatively sparse, when compared to more familiar hazards, such as bacterial pathogens, and this lack of knowledge and understanding poses some exciting and novel challenges for the food industry. The main control measures for protozoan parasites are considered, together with other relevant information that can be used in risk assessment and HACCP, for foods where these infectious agents are relevant. In addition, we also consider aspects of risk communication for outbreak or incident situations.},

	abstract = {Background
Foodborne outbreaks continue to occur regardless of existing food safety measures indicating the shortcomings of these measures to assure food safety. This has led to the recognition of food safety culture as a key contributory factor to the food safety performance of food establishments.
Scope and approach
The aim of this paper is to identify determinants for conducting food safety culture research, using the systems approach as the underlying philosophy to guide the structured reconsideration of national, organisational and safety culture literature, in view of food safety.
Key findings and conclusions
Food safety culture is complex and many interlinking factors are at play. The analysis of ‘culture’ literature showed that food safety culture research should acknowledge the impact of national culture, specify hierarchical level(s) (strategic, tactical, and operational), establish underlying mechanisms, and consider the company's food risks and context characteristics. Major elements to be considered in food safety culture research include organisational and administrative characteristics (i.e. food safety vision, communication, commitment, leadership, training), technical facilities/resources (i.e. food hygiene/safety tools, equipment, \& facilities), employee characteristics (i.e. attitudes, knowledge, perceptions and risk awareness), group characteristics, crucial FSMS characteristics, and actual food safety performance. Methodological requirements for food safety culture research include use of the systems approach, measurable indicators, classification systems for differentiated assessment, and use of multiple methods to enhance research validity. The identified food safety culture research determinants provide an underpinned and transparent starting point to the common understanding and research of food safety culture.},

Two models were proposed, including the effect of temperature or the combined effect of temperature, pH, and concentration of lactic, citric and, acetic acid. Validation of the models included an assessment of the ability to predict maximum specific growth rate μmax using two indices: bias-factor (Bf) and accuracy factor (Af), and the acceptable simulation zone (ASZ). The new models for Salmonella spp. showed good performances with Bf of 1.11–1.10 (model with 1 or 5 variables), and an average of 91\% and 89\% of observations within the ASZ (model with 1 or 5 variables, respectively). Comparing the performances of other existing models when applied to ricotta cheese, a general underprediction of the growth rate was evidenced. The proposed models can be applied by a high number of users with the aim to assess levels of this pathogen in ricotta cheese under both static and dynamic environmental conditions, being useful for the dairy business as the tested conditions cover a wide range of the available brands on the market.},

	abstract = {In the absence of epidemiological, microbiological or outbreak data, systematic identification of the hazards and food products posing the higher risk to the consumers is challenging. It is usually in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where the burden of foodborne disease is highest that data tend to be particularly scarce. In this study, we propose qualitative risk-ranking methods for pathogens and food products that can be used in settings where scarcity of data on the frequency/concentration of pathogens in foodstuff is a barrier towards the use of classical risk assessment frameworks. The approach integrates the existing knowledge on foodborne pathogens, manufacturing processes and intrinsic/extrinsic properties of food products with key context-specific information regarding the supply chain(s), characteristics of the Food Business Operators (FBOs) and cultural habits to identify: (i) the pathogens that should be considered as a “High” food safety priority and (ii) the food products posing the higher risk of consumer exposure to microbiological hazards via the oral (ingestion) route. When applied to the dairy sector of Andhra Pradesh (India) as a case study, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and L. monocytogenes were identified as a “High” food safety priority across all FBOs. C. sakazakii was identified as a “High” priority for the FBOs producing infant formula/milk powder whilst Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. a “High” priority when considering the FBOs operating in the unregulated sector. Given the diversity of dairy products considered in the assessment, cluster analysis was used to identify products that shared similar intrinsic/extrinsic features known to drive the microbiological risk. The risk ranking was then done integrating the results of the cluster analysis with context-specific information. Products manufactured/retailed by FBOs in the informal market were considered as posing a “High” risk for the consumers due to a widespread lack of compliance to sanitary regulations. For dairy products produced by FBOs operating in the middle and formal end of the formal-informal spectrum, the risk of consumers exposure to microbiological hazards ranged from “Moderate” to “Extremely low” depending on the FBO and the intrinsic/extrinsic properties of the products. While providing risk estimates of lower precision if compared to data-driven risk assessments, the proposed method maximises the value of the information that can be easily gathered in LMICs and provide informative outputs to support food safety decision-making in contexts where resources to be allocated for prevention of foodborne diseases are limited and the food system is complex.},

	abstract = {Agrifood systems are undergoing a transformation with the aim to provide safer, more affordable, and healthier diets for all, produced in a sustainable manner while delivering just and equitable livelihoods: a key to achieving the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. However, this transformation needs to be executed in the global context of major challenges facing the food and agriculture sectors, with drivers such as climate change, population growth, urbanization, and natural resources depletion compounding these challenges.

Food safety is a keystone to agrifood systems and all food safety actors need to keep pace with the ongoing transformation while preparing to navigate the potential threats, disruptions, and challenges that may arise. Foresight in food safety facilitates the proactive identification of drivers and related trends, both within and outside agrifood systems, that have implications for food safety and therefore also for consumer health, the national economy, and international trade. Early identification and evaluation of drivers and trends promote strategic planning and preparedness to take advantage of emerging opportunities and address challenges in food safety.

In this publication, the FAO Food Safety Foresight programme provides an overview of the major global drivers and trends by describing their implications for food safety in particular and for agrifood systems by extrapolation. The various drivers and trends reported include climate change, changing consumer behaviour and preferences, new food sources and production systems, technological advances, microbiome, circular economy, food fraud, among others. 

The intended audience for this publication is broad – from the policymakers, academia, food business operators, private sector, to all of us, the consumers.

This DSS will integrate the databases, procedures and methods described above and will be a framework for a generic DSS dedicated to other food. This overall methodology will also be implemented in a complementary Chinese side of the project, and exemplified for each side, with four case studies that were selected to cover priority hazards, main ingredients, processes and control steps of the infant food chain. Resulting databases, tools and procedures will be shared, cross-validated, concatenated, benchmarked and finally harmonized for further use in the EU and China.

	abstract = {As global trade of live animals expands, there is increasing need to assess the risks of invasive organisms, including pathogens, that can accompany these translocations. The movement and release of live baitfish by recreational anglers has been identified as a particularly high-risk pathway for the spread of aquatic diseases in the United States. To provide risk-based decision support for preventing and managing disease invasions from baitfish release, we developed a hazard identification and ranking tool to identify the pathogens that pose the highest risk to wild fish via this pathway. We created a screening protocol and semi-quantitative stochastic risk ranking framework, combining published data with expert elicitation (n = 25) and applied the framework to identify high-priority pathogens for the bait supply in Minnesota, USA. Normalized scores were developed for seven risk criteria (likelihood of transfer, prevalence in bait supply, likelihood of colonization, current distribution, economic impact if established, ecological impact if established and host species) to characterize a pathogen's ability to persist in the bait supply and cause impacts to wild fish species of concern. The generalist macroparasite Schizocotyle acheilognathi was identified as presenting highest overall threat, followed by the microsporidian Ovipleistophora ovariae, and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus. Our findings provide risk-based decision support for managers charged with maintaining both the recreational fishing industry and sustainable, healthy natural resources. Particularly, the identification of several high-risk but currently unregulated pathogens suggests that focusing risk management on pathogens of concern in all potential host species could reduce disease introduction risk. The ranking process, implemented here for a single state case study, provides a conceptual framework for integrating expert opinion and sparse available data that could be scaled up and applied across jurisdictions to inform risk-based management of the live baitfish pathway.},

	abstract = {A stepwise and interactive identification procedure for foodborne microbial hazards has been developed in which use is made of several levels of detail ranging from rough hazard identification to comprehensive hazard identification. This approach allows one to tackle the most obvious hazards first, before focusing on less obvious hazards. The interactive character of the identification procedure is based on the use of several knowledge sources. Combination of knowledge sources, expressed in the use of knowledge rules, supports the user in systematically selecting hazards which may pose a real risk to the consumer. Due to the structured method and the clear definitions of the knowledge rules, the procedure is transparent and may be changed if necessary. The hazard identification procedure has been implemented as a computer program, resulting in a decision-supporting identification system. It provides a way to efficiently assess those hazards which may cause harm if not brought under control during processing. The procedure forms a basis for quantitative risk assessments.},

The ability of a four-strain mixture of spores or vegetative cells of psychrotrophic B. cereus to survive in a commercial, dry infant rice cereal as affected by water activity (aw; 0.27 to 0.28, 0.52 to 0.55, and 0.75 to 0.78), pH (5.6 and 6.7), and temperature (5, 25, 35, and 45°C) was investigated. The rate of death of vegetative cells in dry cereal stored for 36 weeks was not affected by aw or pH. Death of spores in cereal stored at 45°C for up to 48 weeks was enhanced at aw 0.78 but was unaffected by pH; loss of viability at 5, 25, and 35°C was largely unaffected by differences in aw. The effect of temperature (8, 15, 21, and 30°C) on outgrowth of spores of B. cereus inoculated at three levels (0.14, 14, and 133 CFU/g, dry weight basis) into cereal reconstituted with apple juice and commercial pasteurized milk (2\% fat) was also studied. Outgrowth of spores did not occur in cereal reconstituted with apple juice. Cereal reconstituted with milk and inoculated with 0.14,14, and 133 spores per g contained \&gt;3 log CFU/g within 24, 9, and 6 h, respectively, at 21°C. Populations in cereal reconstituted with milk and inoculated with 133 CFU of B. cereus spores per g reached 7.11, 7.72, and 7.40 log CFU/g within 12, 48, and 72 h when stored at 30, 21, and 15°C, respectively. The organism grew in cereal reconstituted with milk and held at 8°C for 72 h; however, enterotoxin was not detected. In reconstituted cereal inoculated with 133 spores per g, enterotoxin was detected (detection limit 16 ng/g) after 24, 48, and 72 h at 30, 21, and 15°C, respectively, when the population of B. cereus reached \&gt;7 log CFU/g.

	abstract = {This contribution presents the bioinactivation software, which implements functions for the modelling of isothermal and non-isothermal microbial inactivation. This software offers features such as user-friendliness, modelling of dynamic conditions, possibility to choose the fitting algorithm and generation of prediction intervals. The software is offered in two different formats: Bioinactivation core and Bioinactivation SE. Bioinactivation core is a package for the R programming language, which includes features for the generation of predictions and for the fitting of models to inactivation experiments using non-linear regression or a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC). The calculations are based on inactivation models common in academia and industry (Bigelow, Peleg, Mafart and Geeraerd). Bioinactivation SE supplies a user-friendly interface to selected functions of Bioinactivation core, namely the model fitting of non-isothermal experiments and the generation of prediction intervals. The capabilities of bioinactivation are presented in this paper through a case study, modelling the non-isothermal inactivation of Bacillus sporothermodurans. This study has provided a full characterization of the response of the bacteria to dynamic temperature conditions, including confidence intervals for the model parameters and a prediction interval of the survivor curve. We conclude that the MCMC algorithm produces a better characterization of the biological uncertainty and variability than non-linear regression. The bioinactivation software can be relevant to the food and pharmaceutical industry, as well as to regulatory agencies, as part of a (quantitative) microbial risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models developed in predictive microbiology are nowadays an essential tool for food scientists and researchers. However, advanced knowledge of scientific programming and mathematical modelling are often required in order to use them, especially in cases of modelling of dynamic and/or non-linear processes. This may be an obstacle for food scientists without such skills. Scientific software can help making these tools more accessible for scientists lacking a deep mathematical or computing background. Recently, the R package bioinactivation was published, including functions (model fitting and predictions) for modelling microbial inactivation under isothermal or dynamic conditions. It was uploaded to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), but users need basic R programming knowledge in order to use it. Therefore, it was accompanied by Bioinactivation SE, a user-friendly web application including selected functions in the software for users without a programming background. In this work, a new web application, Bioinactivation FE, is presented. It is an extension of Bioinactivation SE which includes an interface to every function in the bioinactivation package: model fitting of isothermal and non-isothermal experiments, and generation of survivor curves and prediction intervals. Moreover, it includes several improvements in the user interface based on the users' feedback. The capabilities of the software are demonstrated through two case studies using data published in the scientific literature. In the first case study, the response of Escherichia coli to isothermal and non-isothermal treatments is compared, illustrating the presence of an induced thermal resistance. In the second, the effect of nanoemulsified d-limonene on the thermal resistance of Salmonella Senftenberg is quantified.},

As in the case of other foodborne diseases, unwashed fruits and vegetables, contaminated with dispersed forms of E. multilocularis, may serve as an important transmission route for this parasite. In this article, we reply to the incorrect interpretation of results of our study concerning the detection of E. multilocularis DNA in fresh fruit, vegetable and mushroom samples collected from the highly endemic areas of the Warmia-Masuria Province, Poland, to dispel any doubts. The accusations formulated by the commentators concerning our paper are unfounded; moreover, these commentators demand information which was beyond the purview of our study. Making generalisations and drawing far-reaching conclusions from our work is also unjustified. The majority of positive samples were found in only a few hyperendemic communities; this information corresponds with the highest number of both infected foxes and AE cases in humans recorded in this area. Our findings indicate that E. multilocularis is present in the environment and may create a potential risk for the inhabitants. These people should simply be informed to wash fruits and vegetables before eating. No additional far-reaching conclusions should be drawn from our data. We believe these commentators needlessly misinterpreted our results and disseminated misleading information. Nevertheless, we would like to encourage any readers simply to contact us if any aspects of our study are unclear.},

	abstract = {Decision making in food safety is a complex process that involves several criteria of different nature like the expected reduction in the number of illnesses, the potential economic or health-related cost, or even the environmental impact of a given policy or intervention. Several multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms are currently used, mostly individually, in food safety to rank different options in a multifactorial environment. However, the selection of the MCDA algorithm is a decision problem on its own because different methods calculate different rankings. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of different uncertainty sources on the rankings of MCDA problems in the context of food safety. For that purpose, a previously published data set on emerging zoonoses in the Netherlands was used to compare different MCDA algorithms: MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, WASPAS, and ELECTRE III. The rankings were calculated with and without considering uncertainty (using fuzzy sets), to assess the importance of this factor. The rankings obtained differed between algorithms, emphasizing that the selection of the MCDA method had a relevant impact in the rankings. Furthermore, considering uncertainty in the ranking had a high influence on the results. Both factors were more relevant than the weights associated with each criterion in this case study. A hierarchical clustering method was suggested to aggregate results obtained by the different algorithms. This complementary step seems to be a promising way to decrease extreme difference among algorithms and could provide a strong added value in the decision-making process.},

A literature review was performed to identify and characterize methods for risk ranking from the fields of food, environmental science and socio-economic sciences. The review used a predefined search protocol, and covered the bibliographic databases Scopus, CAB Abstracts, Web of Sciences, and PubMed over the period 1993–2013.All references deemed relevant, on the basis of predefined evaluation criteria, were included in the review, and the risk ranking method characterized. The methods were then clustered—based on their characteristics—into eleven method categories. These categories included: risk assessment, comparative risk assessment, risk ratio method, scoring method, cost of illness, health adjusted life years (HALY), multi-criteria decision analysis, risk matrix, flow charts/decision trees, stated preference techniques and expert synthesis. Method categories were described by their characteristics, weaknesses and strengths, data resources, and fields of applications.It was concluded there is no single best method for risk ranking. The method to be used should be selected on the basis of risk manager/assessor requirements, data availability, and the characteristics of the method.

	abstract = {Background The Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) was established in 2007 by the World Health Organization (WHO) to estimate the global burden of foodborne diseases (FBDs). This estimation is complicated because most of the hazards causing FBD are not transmitted solely by food; most have several potential exposure routes consisting of transmission from animals, by humans, and via environmental routes including water. This paper describes an expert elicitation study conducted by the FERG Source Attribution Task Force to estimate the relative contribution of food to the global burden of diseases commonly transmitted through the consumption of food. Methods and Findings We applied structured expert judgment using Cooke’s Classical Model to obtain estimates for 14 subregions for the relative contributions of different transmission pathways for eleven diarrheal diseases, seven other infectious diseases and one chemical (lead). Experts were identified through international networks followed by social network sampling. Final selection of experts was based on their experience including international working experience. Enrolled experts were scored on their ability to judge uncertainty accurately and informatively using a series of subject-matter specific ‘seed’ questions whose answers are unknown to the experts at the time they are interviewed. Trained facilitators elicited the 5th, and 50th and 95th percentile responses to seed questions through telephone interviews. Cooke’s Classical Model uses responses to the seed questions to weigh and aggregate expert responses. After this interview, the experts were asked to provide 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile estimates for the ‘target’ questions regarding disease transmission routes. A total of 72 experts were enrolled in the study. Ten panels were global, meaning that the experts should provide estimates for all 14 subregions, whereas the nine panels were subregional, with experts providing estimates for one or more subregions, depending on their experience in the region. The size of the 19 hazard-specific panels ranged from 6 to 15 persons with several experts serving on more than one panel. Pathogens with animal reservoirs (e.g. non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii) were in general assessed by the experts to have a higher proportion of illnesses attributable to food than pathogens with mainly a human reservoir, where human-to-human transmission (e.g. Shigella spp. and Norovirus) or waterborne transmission (e.g. Salmonella Typhi and Vibrio cholerae) were judged to dominate. For many pathogens, the foodborne route was assessed relatively more important in developed subregions than in developing subregions. The main exposure routes for lead varied across subregions, with the foodborne route being assessed most important only in two subregions of the European region. Conclusions For the first time, we present worldwide estimates of the proportion of specific diseases attributable to food and other major transmission routes. These findings are essential for global burden of FBD estimates. While gaps exist, we believe the estimates presented here are the best current source of guidance to support decision makers when allocating resources for control and intervention, and for future research initiatives.},

Foodborne illnesses leading to diseases in humans are still frequently reported. To better protect infants and children from foodborne diseases, the SAFFI (Safe Food for Infant) project promoted by the European Union in collaboration with China, will develop an integrative approach to identify, assess, detect and mitigate risks associated with microbial hazards (MHs) and chemical hazards (CHs) in infant foods. The first stage to tackle this issue was to identify relevant hazards in infant foods. By collecting data from the literature, scientific reports, existing databases, and clinical studies and using these data to compile a list of relevant foodborne hazards. These hazards caused major foodborne outbreaks, frequently contaminated foods, have large public health impacts, and/or are dangerous to young children. After the initial identification of MHs and CHs in infant foods, we will prioritize the most relevant MHs or CHs present in specific food products and rank the risks associated with these hazards based on the probability of occurrence and severity of each hazard. Standardized and systematic hazard identification (HI) and risk ranking (RR) procedures will be developed and incorporated into HI and RR computational decision support tools that will serve to help food safety agencies, food companies, and risk assessors to identify and rank MHs and CHs in the entire infant food chain in Europe and China.},

	abstract = {The σB-dependent general stress regulon of Bacillus subtilis comprises more than 150 members. Induction of this regulon by imposition of environmental or metabolic stress confers multiple, nonspecific, and preemptive stress resistance to nongrowing, nonsporulated cells of B. subtilis. In this study we performed a regulon-wide phenotypic screening analysis to determine the stress sensitivity profiles of 94 mutants defective in candidate members of the general stress regulon that were previously identified in our transcriptional profiling study of the general stress response of B. subtilis. The phenotypic screening analysis included analysis of adaptation to a growth-inhibiting concentration of ethanol (10\%, vol/vol) or NaCl (10\%, wt/vol), severe heat shock (54°C), and low temperature (survival at 4°C and growth at 12.5°C). Surprisingly, 85\% of the mutants tested displayed increased sensitivity at an α confidence level of ≤0.01 to at least one of the four stresses tested, and 62\% still exhibited increased sensitivity at an α of ≤0.001. In essence, we were able to assign 63 genes (28 genes with an α of ≤0.001) to survival after ethanol shock, 37 genes (28 genes with an α of ≤0.001) to protection from NaCl shock, 34 genes (24 genes with an α of ≤0.001) to survival at 4°C, and 10 genes (3 genes with an α of ≤0.001) to management of severe heat shock. Interestingly, there was a substantial overlap between the genes necessary for survival during ethanol shock and the genes necessary for survival at 4°C, and there was also an overlap between genes required for survival during ethanol shock and genes required for survival during NaCl shock. Our data provide evidence for the importance of the σB regulon at low temperatures, not only for growth but also for survival. Moreover, the data imply that a secondary oxidative stress seems to be a common component of the severe stresses tested.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is able to colonize human and animal intestinal tracts and to subsequently cross the intestinal barrier, causing systemic infection. For successful establishment of infection, L. monocytogenes must survive the low pH environment of the stomach. L. monocytogenes encodes a functional ArgR, a transcriptional regulator belonging to the ArgR/AhrC arginine repressor family. We aimed at clarifying the specific functions of ArgR in arginine metabolism regulation, and more importantly, in acid tolerance of L. monocytogenes. We showed that ArgR in the presence of 10 mM arginine represses transcription and expression of the argGH and argCJBDF operons, indicating that L. monocytogenes ArgR plays the classical role of ArgR/AhrC family proteins in feedback inhibition of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Notably, transcription and expression of arcA (encoding arginine deiminase) and sigB (encoding an alternative sigma factor B) were also markedly repressed by ArgR when bacteria were exposed to pH 5.5 in the absence of arginine. However, addition of arginine enabled ArgR to derepress the transcription and expression of these two genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ArgR binds to the putative ARG boxes in the promoter regions of argC, argG, arcA, and sigB. Reporter gene analysis with gfp under control of the argG promoter demonstrated that ArgR was able to activate the argG promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of argR significantly increased bacterial survival in BHI medium adjusted to pH 3.5 with lactic acid. We conclude that this phenomenon is due to activation of arcA and sigB. Collectively, our results show that L. monocytogenes ArgR finely tunes arginine metabolism through negative transcriptional regulation of the arginine biosynthetic operons and of the catabolic arcA gene in an arginine-independent manner during lactic acid-induced acid stress. ArgR also appears to activate catabolism as well as sigB transcription by anti-repression in an arginine-dependent way.},

The specific activity of B. thuringiensis against insect larvae is due to the crystal proteins (Cry proteins). Two different transcriptional mechanisms (dependent and independent of sporulation) are responsible for cry gene transcription during the stationary phase. In addition to these specific insecticidal toxins, B. thuringiensis produces potential virulence factors including haemolysins, degradative enzymes and enterotoxins. A pleiotropic regulator (PlcR) that activates the transcription of various genes encoding such extracellular proteins has been identified. Its expression at the onset of the stationary phase is dependent on the growth medium and is controlled by the transition state regulator, Spo0A.},

However, their molecular sensing mechanism remains unclear. CodY is a unique global transcription regulator that recognizes GTP and BCAAs as specific signals and affects expression of more than 100 genes associated with metabolism. Herein, we report the first crystal structures of the full-length CodY complex with sensing molecules and describe their functional states. We observed two different oligomeric states of CodY: a dimeric complex of CodY from Staphylococcus aureus with the two metabolites GTP and isoleucine, and a tetrameric form (apo) of CodY from Bacillus cereus. Notably, the tetrameric state shows in an auto-inhibitory manner by blocking the GTP-binding site, whereas the binding sites of GTP and isoleucine are clearly visible in the dimeric state. The GTP is located at a hinge site between the long helical region and the metabolite-binding site. Together, data from structural and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses improve understanding of how CodY senses GTP and operates as a DNA-binding protein and a pleiotropic transcription regulator.},

	abstract = {In response to nutrient limitation in the environment, the global transcriptional regulator CodY modulates various pathways in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis CodY triggers adaptation to starvation by secretion of proteases coupled to the expression of amino acid transporters. Furthermore, it is involved in modulating survival strategies like sporulation, motility, biofilm formation, and CodY is also known to affect virulence factor production in pathogenic bacteria. In this study, the role of CodY in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, the enterotoxin-producing type strain, is investigated. A marker-less deletion mutant of codY (ΔcodY) was generated in B. cereus and the transcriptome changes were surveyed using DNA microarrays. Numerous genes involved in biofilm formation and amino acid transport and metabolism were upregulated and genes associated with motility and virulence were repressed upon deletion of codY. Moreover, we found that CodY is important for efficient production of toxins and for adapting from nutrient-rich to nutrient-limited growth conditions of B. cereus. In contrast, biofilm formation is highly induced in the ΔcodY mutant, suggesting that CodY represses biofilm formation. Together, these results indicate that CodY plays a crucial role in the growth and persistence of B. cereus in different environments such as soil, food, insect guts and the human body.},

	abstract = {Flagellar motility is considered an important virulence factor in different pathogenic bacteria. In Listeria monocytogenes the transcriptional repressor MogR regulates motility in a temperature-dependent manner, directly repressing flagellar- and chemotaxis genes. The only other bacteria known to carry a mogR homolog are members of the Bacillus cereus group, which includes motile species such as B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis as well as the non-motile species Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus pseudomycoides. Furthermore, the main motility locus in B. cereus group bacteria, carrying the genes for flagellar synthesis, appears to be more closely related to L. monocytogenes than to Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to a separate phylogenetic group of Bacilli and does not carry a mogR ortholog. Here, we show that in B. thuringiensis, MogR overexpression results in non-motile cells devoid of flagella. Global gene expression profiling showed that 110 genes were differentially regulated by MogR overexpression, including flagellar motility genes, but also genes associated with virulence, stress response and biofilm lifestyle. Accordingly, phenotypic assays showed that MogR also affects cytotoxicity and biofilm formation in B. thuringiensis. Overexpression of a MogR variant mutated in two amino acids within the putative DNA binding domain restored phenotypes to those of an empty vector control. In accordance, introduction of these mutations resulted in complete loss in MogR binding to its candidate flagellar locus target site in vitro. In contrast to L. monocytogenes, MogR appears to be regulated in a growth-phase dependent and temperature-independent manner in B. thuringiensis 407. Interestingly, mogR was found to be conserved also in non-motile B. cereus group species such as B. mycoides and B. pseudomycoides, which both carry major gene deletions in the flagellar motility locus and where in B. pseudomycoides mogR is the only gene retained. Furthermore, mogR is expressed in non-motile B. anthracis. Altogether this provides indications of an expanded set of functions for MogR in B. cereus group species, beyond motility regulation. In conclusion, MogR constitutes a novel B. thuringiensis pleiotropic transcriptional regulator, acting as a repressor of motility genes, and affecting the expression of a variety of additional genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence.},

This comparison of heat resistances of microorganisms facilitates the evaluation of which (groups of) organisms might be troublesome in a production process in which heat treatment is critical to reducing the microbial contaminants, and also allows fine-tuning of the process parameters. Various sources of microbiological variability are discussed and compared for a range of species, including spore-forming and non-spore-forming pathogens and spoilage organisms. This benchmarking of variability factors gives crucial information about the most important factors that should be included in risk assessments to realistically predict heat inactivation of bacteria and spores as part of the measures for controlling shelf life and safety of food products.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rising temperatures for inactivation of norovirus genogroup (G) II and murine norovirus 1 in samples of tomato sauce (72-74 °C for 1 min) and ground meat (100 °C for 30 min). Spiking experiments were carried out in triplicate using TRIzol® reagent method associated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) TaqMan™ system combined with previous free RNA digestion. Success rate and efficiency recoveries of both viruses as well limit of detection of a method for each matrix were also conducted. The heat treatment applied here proved to be efficient to reduce the burden of norovirus GII in a range of 1-4 log10 genomic copies per gram (percentage ranging from 0.45 to 104.54\%) in both matrices. The experiments in this study showed that the results of norovirus GII and murine norovirus 1 in tomato sauce and ground meat tested during thermal treatments cannot be generalized to other food matrices, since there may be food-specific protective effects, as the presence of different components, that can interfere in virus inactivation. Studies using different food matrices reinforce the importance to investigate viruses' inactivation thermal processes in foods due to the resistance of these viruses to adverse conditions, contributing to food security in food virology.},

To prevent virus transmission, heating can be applied to the berries. Here, the thermal inactivation of hNV in strawberry puree was assessed. Due to the lack of a reliable system for hNV infectivity assessment, capsid integrity assays using RNase treatment prior to detection of protected viral RNA were applied. In addition, murine norovirus (MNV) and Tulane virus (TV) served as surrogates. The method was optimized to allow direct comparisons between the viruses. The results indicated that infectious MNV is slightly more stable than TV. Both viruses were completely inactivated ({\textgreater}7 log10 reductions) after treatment at 80 °C for 8 s. TV infectivity decreased faster than capsid-protected RNA. In addition, TV showed a markedly lower stability compared to hNV using capsid integrity assays. Predictive models were generated for all viruses and D- and ɀ-values were calculated. The tertiary model covering reduction of hNV capsid-protected RNA between 50 and 80 °C suggests that temperatures under 70 °C are not reliable for inactivation. About 3.5 log10 reductions are achieved by heating at 80 °C for 8 s. Further studies should focus on the model validation with direct hNV infectivity data.},

Currently, there is no standardized method for evaluating thermal stability of HEV and also a lack of a suitable assay that can distinguish between intact HEV that can cause an infection and damaged virus which is not capable of causing an infection.  This has raised concerns as it is extremely difficult to extrapolate the risk from pork products in relation to cooking practices.

	abstract = {Heat treatment, or thermal disinfection, is one of the simplest disinfection methods, and is widely used in the water, sanitation, and food sectors, especially in low resource settings. Pathogen reductions achieved during heat treatment are influenced by a combination of temperature and exposure time. The objective of this paper was to construct updated time-temperature pathogen inactivation curves to define “safety zones” for the reduction of four pathogen groups (bacteria, viruses, protozoan (oo)cysts, and helminth eggs) during heat treatment in a variety of matrices. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the times needed to achieve specified levels of pathogen reduction at different temperatures. Web of Science was searched using a Boolean string to target studies of heat treatment and pasteurization systems that exposed pathogens in water, wastewater, biosolids, soil, or food matrices to temperatures between 20 °C and 95 °C. Data were extracted from tables or figures and regression was used to assess the relationship between time and temperature. Our findings indicate that the temperatures and times needed to achieve a 1-log10 reduction of all pathogen groups are likely higher and longer, respectively, than previously reported. The type of microorganism and the matrix significantly impact T90 values reported at different temperatures. At high temperatures, the time-temperature curves are controlled by thermally stable viruses such as hepatitis A virus. Data gaps include the lack of data on protozoa, and the lack of data on all pathogen groups at low temperatures, for long exposure times, and with high log10 reductions. The findings from this study can be used by engineers, food safety specialists for the planning and design of engineered water, sanitation, and food pasteurization and treatment systems.},

Soft fruits, such as red berries, exposed to faecal contamination are increasingly responsible for collective food-borne illnesses associated with HAV, when eaten raw or used in unprocessed foods. Heat is the most effective measure for the inactivation of HAV. Thermal treatments are used on fruits as a decontamination method, but they have to be adapted to product characteristics; indeed, factors such as sugar or pH may have an impact on the viral sensitivity to thermal treatments. A model was developed for the inactivation of HAV in red berries without supplemented sugar and with different pH values. Nonlinear inactivation curves in acidified raspberries were modelled using an integrated model, with a single equation nesting secondary models of temperature and pH in the primary model. Model predictions were then confronted to experimental results obtained in another laboratory on other berries with different pH values. Excellent predictions were obtained in most cases, while failed predictions provided safe results, with the model predicting higher residual virus titres than what was observed.},

To study the heat stability of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins, we needed to measure and compare the activity of botulinum neurotoxins, serotypes A and B, under various pasteurization conditions. Currently, the only accepted assay to detect active C. botulinum neurotoxin is an in vivo mouse bioassay, which raises ethical concerns with regard to the use of experimental animals. In this study, noninvasive methods were used to simultaneously detect and distinguish between active BoNT serotypes A and B in one reaction and sample. We developed an enzymatic activity assay employing internally quenched fluorogenic peptides corresponding to SNAP-25, for BoNT-A, and VAMP2, for BoNT-B, as an alternative method to the mouse bioassay. Because each peptide is labeled with different fluorophores, we were able to distinguish between these two toxins. We used this method to analyze the heat stability of BoNT-A and BoNT-B. This study reports that conventional milk pasteurization (63 °C, 30 min) inactivated BoNT serotype A; however, serotype B is heat-stable in milk and not inactivated by pasteurization. Using this activity assay, we also showed that the commonly used food processes such as acidity and pasteurization, which are known to inhibit C. botulinum growth and toxin production, are more effective in inactivating BoNT serotype A than serotype B when conventional pasteurization (63 °C, 30 min) is used.},

Due to its high toxicity and the availability of the producing organism Clostridium botulinum, BoNT is regarded as a potential biological warfare agent. Because of the mild pasteurization process, as well as rapid product distribution and consumption, the milk supply chain has long been considered a potential target of a bioterrorist attack. Since, to our knowledge, no empirical data on the inactivation of BoNT in milk during pasteurization are available at this time, we investigated the activities of BoNT type A (BoNT/A) and BoNT/B, as well as their respective complexes, during a laboratory-scale pasteurization process. When we monitored milk alkaline phosphatase activity, which is an industry-accepted parameter of successfully completed pasteurization, our method proved comparable to the industrial process. After heating raw milk spiked with a set amount of BoNT/A or BoNT/B or one of their respective complexes, the structural integrity of the toxin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and its functional activity by mouse bioassay. We demonstrated that standard pasteurization at 72°C for 15 s inactivates at least 99.99\% of BoNT/A and BoNT/B and at least 99.5\% of their respective complexes. Our results suggest that if BoNTs or their complexes were deliberately released into the milk supply chain, standard pasteurization conditions would reduce their activity much more dramatically than originally anticipated and thus lower the threat level of the widely discussed “BoNT in milk” scenario.},

Among the SEs, SEA appears to be most frequently associated with food poisoning. SEA can be produced at the temperature range of 10-46 degrees C. Many researchers investigated SEA in various foods such as milk, cream, egg and mushroom at some temperatures. As the temperature is raised, SEA concentration was increased. But, because detailed relationships between SEA production and incubation temperature were not examined, we investigated the effect of incubation temperature (10, 15, 20 and 37 degrees C) on SEA productions by using various SEA producing strains of S. aureus. As a result, relationships were found between incubation temperature and SEA production as well as the studies of others. However, little relationship was found between the maximal SEA concentrations at each incubation temperature. SEA production does not necessarily depend on temperature. This result suggests that SEA production is strongly influenced by the intrinsic properties of strains as well as the environmental factors such as temperature and nutrients.},

All samples (100\%; 38/38) were SE-positive before heat treatment, and the positivity rates decreased after heat treatment at 100°C, 110°C, and 121°C to 36.8\% (14/38), 34.2\% (13/38), and 31.6\% (12/38), respectively. The rates of positive samples differed between SEA, SEB, and SEC producers: SEA was detected in the highest amounts both before and after heat treatment. The amount of SE (expressed as test values) decreased significantly after heat treatment. Comparing amounts of SE in positive and negative samples before and after heat treatment, we can conclude that the success of SE inactivation depends on the amount present before heat treatment. The highest amount of SE and the highest rate of SE-positive samples after all heat treatments were found in samples with strains producing SEA. For SEB and SEC, lower amounts of enterotoxin were present and were inactivated at 100°C. Although temperatures of 100°C, 110°C, and 121°C may inactivate SE in milk, the key measures in prevention of staphylococcal enterotoxicosis are avoiding initial contamination of milk by Staph. aureus, promoting consumption of heat-treated milk, and preventing disruption of the cold chain during milk production and processing.},

	abstract = {Cereulide, which can be produced by Bacillus cereus, is strongly associated with emetic-type food poisoning outbreaks. It is an extremely stable emetic toxin, which is unlikely to be inactivated by food processing. Considering the high toxicity of cereulide, its related hazards raise public concerns. A better understanding of the impact of B. cereus and cereulide is urgently needed to prevent contamination and toxin production, thereby protecting public health. Over the last decade, a wide range of research has been conducted regarding B. cereus and cereulide. Despite this, summarized information highlighting precautions at the public level involving the food industry, consumers and regulators is lacking. Therefore, the aim of the current review is to summarize the available data describing the characterizations and impacts of emetic B. cereus and cereulide; based on this information, precautions at the public level are proposed.},

	abstract = {Aims: The study describes the effects of heating temperature and exposure time on the thermal stability of cereulide under different conditions (pH, presence/absence of oil phase and cereulide concentration). Methods and Results: Cereulide heat inactivation was investigated at 100, 121 and 150°C under different alkaline pH values (8.6–10.6) and in the presence of oil phase (0.6–1.4\%). Three different cereulide concentrations (0.5, 5 and 6 μg ml−1) were used. Cereulide detection was performed with computer-aided semen analyzer and with HPLC–MS. Highly alkaline pH was needed to achieve inactivation. At lower cereulide concentrations less drastic conditions were needed. Removal of alkaline buffer after the heat treatment resulted in the recovery of toxic activity. Conclusions: Heat stability of cereulide has been proved to be remarkable, even at highly alkaline pH values, at all temperatures tested. The loss of activity appeared to be reversible. Significance and Impact of the Study: The study demonstrates the inability of any heat treatment used in the food industry to inactivate cereulide. Food safety has to rely on prevention and cold chain maintenance. Cleaning practices also need to be adapted as cereulide may remain in its active form upon sterilization of used material.},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring and surveillance activities carried out in 2021 in 27 MSs, the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and nine non-MSs. Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. In 2021, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. Cases of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis increased in comparison with 2020, but decreased compared with previous years. In 2021, data collection and analysis at the EU level were still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the control measures adopted in the MSs, including partial or total lockdowns. Sixteen MSs and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) achieved all the established targets in poultry populations for reduction in Salmonella prevalence for the relevant serovars. Salmonella samples from carcases of various animal species and samples for Campylobacter quantification from broiler carcases were more frequently positive when performed by the competent authorities than when own-checks were conducted. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases, with the most hospitalisations and highest case fatality rates. Overall, MSs reported more foodborne outbreaks and cases in 2021 than in 2020. S. Enteritidis remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in ‘eggs and egg products’ and in ‘mixed foods’ were the agent/food pairs of most concern. Outbreaks linked to ‘vegetables and juices and products thereof’ rose considerably compared with previous years. This report also provides updates on brucellosis, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), echinococcosis, rabies, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis or M. caprae, and tularaemia.},

Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis and the increasing European Union (EU) trend for confirmed human cases since 2008 stabilised during 2012–2016. In food, the occurrence of Campylobacter remained high in broiler meat. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed human salmonellosis cases since 2008 ended during 2012–2016, and the proportion of human Salmonella Enteritidis cases increased. Most MS met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, except five MS for laying hens. At primary production level, the EU-level flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, broilers, breeding and fattening turkeys decreased or stabilised compared with previous years but the EU prevalence of S. Enteritidis in laying hens significantly increased. In foodstuffs, the EU-level Salmonella non-compliance for minced meat and meat preparations from poultry was low. The number of human listeriosis confirmed cases further increased in 2016, despite the fact that Listeria seldom exceeds the EU food safety limit in ready-to-eat foods. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed yersiniosis cases since 2008 stabilised during 2012–2016, and also the number of confirmed Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in humans was stable. In total, 4,786 food-borne outbreaks, including waterborne outbreaks, were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected causative agent – with one out of six outbreaks due to S.

	abstract = {The European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control analysed the information submitted by 27 European Union Member States on the occurrence of zoonoses and food-borne outbreaks in 2011. Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis with 220,209 confirmed human cases. The occurrence of Campylobacter continued to be high in broiler meat at EU level. The decreasing trend in confirmed salmonellosis cases in humans continued with a total of 95,548 cases in 2011. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, and Salmonella is declining in these populations. In foodstuffs, Salmonella was most often detected in meat and products thereof. The number of confirmed human listeriosis cases decreased to 1,476. Listeria was seldom detected above the legal safety limit from ready-to-eat foods. A total of 9,485 confirmed verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) infections were reported. This represents an increase of 159.4 \% compared with 2010 as a result of the large STEC/VTEC outbreak that occurred in 2011 in the EU, primarily in Germany. VTEC was also reported from food and animals. The number of human yersiniosis cases increased to 7,017 cases. Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated also from pig meat and pigs; 132 cases of Mycobacterium bovis and 330 cases of brucellosis in humans were also reported. The prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle increased, and the prevalence of brucellosis decreased in cattle and sheep and goat populations. Trichinellosis and echinococcosis caused 268 and 781 human cases, respectively and these parasites were mainly detected in wildlife. The numbers of alveolar and of cystic echinococcosis respectively increased and decreased in the last five years. One imported human case of rabies was reported. The number of rabies cases in animals continued to decrease. Most of the 5,648 reported food-borne outbreaks were caused by Salmonella,bacterial toxins, Campylobacter and viruses, and the main food sources were eggs, mixed foods and fish and fishery products.},

	abstract = {This report of the EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2020 in 27 EU Member States (MS) and nine non-MS. Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. Two events impacted 2020 MS data collection and related statistics: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2020, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) from 2016 to 2020. Fourteen of the 26 MS reporting data on Salmonella control programmes in poultry met the reduction targets for all poultry categories. Salmonella results for carcases of various species performed by competent authorities were more frequently positive than own-checks conducted by food business operators. This was also the case for Campylobacter quantification results from broiler carcases for the MS group that submitted data from both samplers, whereas overall at EU level, those percentages were comparable. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, with 10-fold less cases reported than salmonellosis, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. Illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases with the highest case fatality. In 2020, 27 MS reported 3,086 foodborne outbreaks (a 47.0\% decrease from 2019) and 20,017 human cases (a 61.3\% decrease). Salmonella remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in ‘eggs and egg products’, norovirus in ‘crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and products containing them’ and L. monocytogenes in ‘fish and fish products’ were the agent/food pairs of most concern. This report also provides updates on tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium caprae, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

Campylobacteriosis was the commonest reported zoonosis and its EU trend for confirmed human cases increasing since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed human salmonellosis cases since 2008 ended during 2013–2017, and the proportion of human Salmonella Enteritidis cases increased, mostly due to one MS starting to report serotype data. Sixteen MS met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 12 MS failed meeting at least one. The EU flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased or remained stable compared to 2016, and slightly increased in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results on pig carcases and target Salmonella serovar results for poultry from competent authorities tended to be generally higher compared to those from food business operators. The notification rate of human listeriosis further increased in 2017, despite Listeria seldom exceeding the EU food safety limit in ready-to-eat food. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed yersiniosis cases since 2008 stabilised during 2013–2017. The number of confirmed shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in humans was stable. A total of 5,079 food-borne (including waterborne) outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the commonest detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one out of seven outbreaks, followed by other bacteria, bacterial toxins and viruses. The agent was unknown in 37.6\% of all outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and Salmonella in meat and meat products were the highest risk agent/food pairs. The report further summarises trends and sources for bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), West Nile virus and tularaemia.},

However, HPP remains to be fully understood, particularly regarding hazards and process validation to mitigate microbiological risks. One of the challenges is understanding the large variation in the sensitivity of pathogenic strains to pressure associated with microbial genotypes, phenotypes, and food composition. This manuscript provides an overview of barotolerance mechanisms and the influence of pH and soluble solids in low- and high-acidity juices in the resistance of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes, as well as their surrogates. The presented information can be used in the selection of challenge microorganisms for validation tests, including the results of a few studies with tropical and blended fruit and vegetable juices and the influence of the food matrix on the high pressure resistance of pathogenic strains.},

	abstract = {Typhoid fever transmission occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with Salmonella Typhi, and case–control studies are often conducted to identify outbreak sources and transmission vehicles. However, there is no current summary of the associations among water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and food exposures and typhoid from case–control studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case–control studies to evaluate the associations among typhoid fever and predicted WASH or food exposure risk factors (13), and protective factors (7). Overall, 19 manuscripts describing 22 case–control studies were included. Two studies were characterized as having low risk of bias, one as medium risk, and 19 as high risk. In total, nine of 13 predicted risk factors were associated with increased odds of typhoid (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4–2.4, I2 = 30.5–74.8\%.), whereas five of seven predicted protective factors were associated with lower odds of typhoid (OR = 0.52–0.73, I2 = 38.7–84.3\%). In five types of sensitivity analyses, two (8\%) of 26 summary associations changed significance from the original analysis. Results highlight the following: the importance of household hygiene transmission pathways, the need for further research around appropriate food interventions and the risk of consuming specific foods and beverages outside the home, and the absence of any observed association between sanitation exposures and typhoid fever. We recommend that typhoid interventions focus on interrupting household transmission routes and that future studies provide more detailed information about WASH and food exposures to inform better targeted interventions.},

These included strain, temperature and humidity, and medium used to suspend the organism. Of the strains evaluated, all of three isolates of Campylobacter jejuni exhibited greater tolerance to drying than did a strain of nalidixic acid resistant, thermophilic Campylobacter . Inconsistent results were obtained when organisms were dried and maintained at 25 C. Viable cells from two of four strains having an initial population of {\textgreater}107 were not recovered after 24 h in an anhydrous environment at 25 C. Under comparable conditions, drying C. jejuni FRI-CF8 in the presence of skim milk at 25 C resulted in a {\textgreater}107 log10 reduction of cells within 1 day in one instance; a 5 log10 decline after 7 days in another; and inactivation at an intermediate rate on a third occasion. Rates of death were greatly reduced when cells were dried and held at 4 C. At this temperature and in the presence of skim milk and an anhydrous environment, a 5 log10 reduction of CF8 occurred after 6 weeks. In all instances, greater survival occurred when organisms were dried in the presence of Brucella broth than in skim milk. When held in environments of different relative humidities (RH), survival was greatest in the presence of 14\% or less RH. Results suggest that C. jejuni is generally quite sensitive to drying and storage at room temperature, but, at refrigeration temperature and the appropriate humidity, large numbers may survive drying and remain viable for several weeks.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter species are the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with C. jejuni responsible for the majority of these cases. Although it is clear that livestock, and particularly poultry, are the most common source, it is likely that the natural environment (soil and water) plays a key role in transmission, either directly to humans or indirectly via farm animals. It has been shown using multilocus sequence typing that some clonal complexes (such as ST-45) are more frequently isolated from environmental sources such as water, suggesting that strains vary in their ability to survive in the environment. Although C. jejuni are fastidious microaerophiles generally unable to grow in atmospheric levels of oxygen, C. jejuni can adapt to survival in the environment, exhibiting aerotolerance and starvation survival. Biofilm formation, the viable but nonculturable state, and interactions with other microorganisms can all contribute to survival outside the host. By exploiting high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and RNA Seq, we are well placed to decipher the mechanisms underlying the variations in survival between strains in environments such as soil and water and to better understand the role of environmental persistence in the transmission of C. jejuni directly or indirectly to humans.},

A total of 91 out of the 1071 samples were positive for B. cereus. The contamination level of B. cereus in 0.5 \% of RTE rice product samples outnumbered 103 CFU/g. The number of B. cereus attained 105−106 CFU/g in one sample. The distribution patterns of virulence genes in B. cereus isolates were identified. 84.6\% of the B. cereus isolates had at least one enterotoxin or emetic toxin gene. The predominant pattern was XXV. 9.9\% of isolates belonged to it and possessed one enterotoxin gene entFM. The occurrence rate of hblACD and nheABC was 36.3\% and 47.3\%, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed a high resistance rate toward penicillin, and 23.1\% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. B. cereus isolates were genotyped by using ERIC-PCR. 89 genotypes were determined. The Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) attained 0.9995. Relationships analysis revealed that Group A B. cereus isolates tended to carry hblA, hblC, hblD, nheA, nheB, and show resistance to penicillin/trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies.},

	abstract = {In a recent report by risk assessment experts on the identification of food safety priorities using the Delphi technique, foodborne viruses were recognized among the top rated food safety priorities and have become a greater concern to the food industry over the past few years. Food safety experts agreed that control measures for viruses throughout the food chain are required. However, much still needs to be understood with regard to the effectiveness of these controls and how to properly validate their performance, whether it is personal hygiene of food handlers or the effects of processing of at risk foods or the interpretation and action required on positive virus test result. This manuscript provides a description of foodborne viruses and their characteristics, their responses to stress and technologies developed for viral detection and control. In addition, the gaps in knowledge and understanding, and future perspectives on the application of viral detection and control strategies for the food industry, along with suggestions on how the food industry could implement effective control strategies for viruses in foods. The current state of the science on epidemiology, public health burden, risk assessment and management options for viruses in food processing environments will be highlighted in this review.},

At an inoculum level of 10(7) CFU/disk, most of the salmonellae (14/18) and the STEC strains (31/35) survived with a population of 10(3) to 10(4) CFU/disk, whereas all of the shigellae (5/5) and the majority of the nonpathogenic E. coli strains (9/15) did not survive (the population was decreased to less than the detection limit of 10(2) CFU/disk). After 22 to 24 months of subsequent storage at 4 degrees C, all of the selected salmonellae (4/4) and most of the selected STEC strains (12/15) survived, keeping the original populations (10(3) to 10(4) CFU/disk). In contrast to the case for storage at 4 degrees C, all of 15 selected strains (5 strains each of Salmonella spp., STEC O157, and STEC O26) died after 35 to 70 days of storage at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The survival rates of all of these 15 strains in paper disks after the 24 h of drying were substantially increased (10 to 79 times) by the presence of sucrose (12\% to 36\%). All of these 15 desiccated strains in paper disks survived after exposure to 70 degrees C for 5 h. The populations of these 15 strains inoculated in dried foods containing sucrose and/or fat (e.g., chocolate) were 100 times higher than those in the dried paper disks after drying for 24 h at 25 degrees C.},

Foods are not sterile; they have a natural flora and a transient flora reflecting their environment. To ensure food is safe, we must destroy these microorganisms or prevent their growth. Recurring hazards due to lapses in the handling, processing, and distribution of foods cannot be solved by obsolete methods and inadequate proposals. They require positive approach and resolution through the pooling of accumulated knowledge. As the industrial domain evolves rapidly and we are faced with pressures to continually improve both products and processes, a considerable competitive advantage can be gained by the introduction of predictive modeling in the food industry. Research and development capital concerns of the industry have been preserved by investigating the plethora of factors able to react on the final product. The presence of microorganisms in foods is critical for the quality of the food. However, microbial behavior is closely related to the properties of food itself such as water activity, pH, storage conditions, temperature, and relative humidity. The effect of these factors together contributing to permitting growth of microorganisms in foods can be predicted by mathematical modeling issued from quantitative studies on microbial populations. The use of predictive models permits us to evaluate shifts in microbial numbers in foods from harvesting to production, thus having a permanent and objective evaluation of the involving parameters. In this vein, predictive microbiology is the study of the microbial behavior in relation to certain environmental conditions, which assure food quality and safety. Microbial responses are evaluated through developed mathematical models, which must be validated for the specific case. As a result, predictive microbiology modeling is a useful tool to be applied for quantitative risk assessment. Herein, we review the predictive models that have been adapted for improvement of the food industry chain through a built virtual prototype of the final product or a process reflecting real-world conditions. It is then expected that predictive models are, nowadays, a useful and valuable tool in research as well as in industrial food conservation processes.},

	abstract = {Overall, the models developed in predictive microbiology aim at the quantification of the effects of intrinsic, extrinsic and/or processing factors on the resulting microbial proliferation in food products or food model systems, for example, a buffer system. These models rely on the possibility to interpolate the resulting microbial proliferation for combinations that are not only originally examined, but also included in the range of the experiment design. As such, predictive microbiology can be considered as a powerful tool to investigate and summarize succinctly the effect of varying conditions (within food formulation and processing) on the microbial ecology. A historical perspective of modeling developments in the area of predictive microbiology was presented by Mafart in 2005. According to that, the first developments date back to 1920s when heat resistance of microorganisms was described by either the Arrhenius equation or the Bigelow model. Nevertheless, the principles and goals of the discipline appeared much later, at the beginning of the 1990s, followed by the development and description of microbial models and the generation of relevant databases and other software tools.},

	abstract = {Background:  In genomics, we often assume that continuous data, such as gene expression, follow a specific kind of distribution. However we rarely stop to question the validity of this assumption, or consider how broadly applicable it may be to all genes that are in the transcriptome. Our study investigated the prevalence of a range of gene expression distributions in three different tumor types from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Results:  Surprisingly, the expression of less than 50\% of all genes was Normallydistributed, with other distributions including Gamma, Bimodal, Cauchy, and Lognormal also represented. Most of the distribution categories contained genes that were significantly enriched for unique biological processes. Different assumptions based on the shape of the expression profile were used to identify genes that could discriminate between patients with good versus poor survival. The prognostic marker genes that were identified when the shape of the distribution was accounted for reflected functional insights into cancer biology that were not observed when standard assumptions were applied. We showed that when multiple types of distributions were permitted, i.e. the shape of the expression profile was used, the statistical classifiers had greater predictive accuracy for determining the prognosis of a patient versus those that assumed only one type of gene expression distribution.
Conclusions:  Our results highlight the value of studying a gene’s distribution shape to model heterogeneity of transcriptomic data and the impact on using analyses that permit more than one type of gene expression distribution. These insights would have been overlooked when using standard approaches that assume all genes follow the same type of distribution in a patient cohort.},

While insights have been derived for almost all levels of genome function, most importantly, statistics has had the greatest impact on improving our knowledge of transcriptional regulation. But the drive to extract the most meaningful inferences from big data can often force us to overlook the fundamental role that statistics plays, and specifically, the basic assumptions that we make about big data. Normality is a statistical property that is often swept up into an assumption that we may or may not be consciously aware of making. This review highlights the inherent value of non-normal distributions to big data analysis by discussing use cases of nonnormality that focus on gene expression data.

	abstract = {The induction of stress proteins is an important component of the adaptional network of a non-growing cell of Bacillus subtilis. A diverse range of stresses such as heat shock, salt stress, ethanol, starvation for oxygen or nutrients etc. induce the same set of proteins, called general stress proteins. Although the adaptive functions of these proteins are largely unknown, they are proposed to provide general and rather non-specific protection of the cell under these adverse conditions. In addition to these non-specific general stress proteins, all extracellular signals induce a set of specific stress proteins that may confer specific protection against a particular stress factor. In B. subtilis at least three different classes of heat-inducible genes can be defined by their common regulatory characteristics: Class I genes, as exemplified by the dnaK and groE operons, are most efficiently induced by heat stress. Their expression involves a sigma A-dependent promoter, an inverted repeat (called the CIRCE element) highly conserved among eubacteria, and probably a repressor interacting with the CIRCE element. The majority of general stress genes (class II, more than 40) are induced at sigma B-dependent promoters by different growth-inhibiting conditions. The activation of sigma B by stress or starvation is the crucial event in the induction of this large stress regulon. Only a few genes, including Ion, clpC, clpP, and ftsH, can respond to different stress factors independently of sigma B or CIRCE (class III). Stress induction of these genes occurs at promoters presumably recognized by sigma A and probably involves additional regulatory elements which remain to be defined.},

	abstract = {All organisms respond to a sudden increase in temperature by the so-called heat shock response. This response results in the induction of a subset of genes, designated heat shock genes coding for heat shock proteins, which allow the cell to cope with the stress regimen. Research carried out during the last 10 years with eubacteria has revealed that the heat shock genes of a given species fall into different classes (regulons), where each class is regulated by a different transcriptional regulator, which could be an alternative sigma factor, a transcriptional activator, or a transcriptional repressor. All regulons of a single species constitute the heat shock stimulon. In Bacillus subtilis, more than 200 genes representing over 7\% of the transcriptionally active genes are induced at least 3-fold in response to a heat shock. This response becomes apparent within the first minute after exposure to heat stress, is transient, and is coordinated by at least 5 transcriptional regulator proteins, including 2 repressors, an alternate sigma-factor, and a 2-component signal transduction system. A detailed analysis of the regulation of all known heat shock genes has shown that they belong to at least 6 regulons that together comprise the B subtilis heat shock stimulon. Potential thermosensors are discussed in this article.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this project was to improve the ability to perform risk ranking of current chemical and microbiological hazards in foods. The work was performed in three work packages (WPs) comprising an overview of chemical and microbiological risk assessment (WP1), development of methods for risk ranking (WP2), and the organisation of an international workshop (WP3). The developmental work consisted of 1) a method for chemical hazards that was also adapted for newer toxicological effect data, and 2) an exposure model applicable to both types of hazards in its design. Conclusions at the workshop included that risk ranking fundamentally would provide added support to risk management and risk communication. Both probability and severity of a health effect was regarded to be relevant to incorporate in the metric used for risk ranking. Measures of health burden were regarded as useful by many participants but there was no consensus on the most preferable metric. The value of other metrics, including less data intensive ones, was also noted. While risk ranking should be based on risk assessment principles, management aspects would ultimately need to be considered on top of this. Participants were positive to a joint framework for both chemical and microbiological hazards, but several challenges were identified. In the face of a general lack of desired data it was regarded to be important to make efficient use of the available information, and it may be advantageous if methods are compatible with different sets of evidence. It is recommended that the common metric for risk ranking is further resolved in terms of what aspects it should account for, the usefulness of particular or different metrics, as well as the concept of a tiered approach. Development of an overarching guidance for risk ranking addressing the many types of rankings possible is proposed.},

The large differences in local moisture content and temperature across the sheet which develop quickly under high intensity impingement drying provide the potential for reducing drying time by sheet reversal between impingement drying cylinders. This advantage was determined experimentally under low intensity impingement drying conditions. Use of the micro-scale based McGill dryer simulator for determining the advantage from sheet reversal between impingement drying cylinders was demonstrated for both laboratory and industrial impingement drying intensities. For completing the drying of 205 g/m2 linerboard from 0.3 to 0.5 kg/kg dry under 400°C air jets of Re 20000, drying time is about 30\% less with sheet reversal between two impingement drying cylinders than for a single, larger diameter cylinder. This extensively validated dryer simulator enables determining advantageous design specifications and operating conditions for hybrid dryer sections involving combinations of cylinder and impingement air drying, a concept with potential to become common industrial practice.},

	abstract = {Combustion of fuels provides more than 90\% of the worlds׳ primary energy demand at the costs of negative environmental impacts. In the recent years, substantial research has been carried out to explore clean and efficient combustion technologies to meet the ever-increasing demand for sustainable energy production using both fossil and renewable fuels at stringent environmental standards. In relation to advanced combustion technologies such as moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD), pulse combustion is one of the most promising techniques to burn diversified fuels ranging from high-grade natural gas and propane to low-grade fuels such as biogas, syngas or biodiesel high combustion efficiencies and minimal pollutant emissions (e.g., SOx, NOx). In spite of growing interest in pulse combustion technology, its state-of-the art is largely missing in the literature. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive yet concise review of pulse combustion regarding the phenomenon and background of such combustion, modeling, experimental findings and industrial applications. First, the basics of pulse combustion are presented which include pulse combustor classification and types, operation principles, and advantages and disadvantages. In view of sustainability, pulse combustion characteristics with different fuel (e.g., biogas) are fully elaborated. Then, pulse combustion models described in topical literature are classified into different types and thoroughly examined. Next, experimental and numerical studies performed by numerous researchers are summarized, and the applications of pulse combustion in different fields, particularly in drying are presented, and its great potential to promote the utilization of renewable fuels is analyzed. Finally, the barriers, challenges, and R\&D for pulse combustion are identified and a constructive discussion on these issues is provided. Key publications for the readers seeking broader and in-depth information are also given.},

	abstract = {Flagellar motility is considered an important virulence factor in different pathogenic bacteria. In Listeria monocytogenes the transcriptional repressor MogR regulates motility in a temperature-dependent manner, directly repressing flagellar- and chemotaxis genes. The only other bacteria known to carry a mogR homolog are members of the Bacillus cereus group, which includes motile species such as B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis as well as the non-motile species Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus pseudomycoides. Furthermore, the main motility locus in B. cereus group bacteria, carrying the genes for flagellar synthesis, appears to be more closely related to L. monocytogenes than to Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to a separate phylogenetic group of Bacilli and does not carry a mogR ortholog. Here, we show that in B. thuringiensis, MogR overexpression results in non-motile cells devoid of flagella. Global gene expression profiling showed that 110 genes were differentially regulated by MogR overexpression, including flagellar motility genes, but also genes associated with virulence, stress response and biofilm lifestyle. Accordingly, phenotypic assays showed that MogR also affects cytotoxicity and biofilm formation in B. thuringiensis. Overexpression of a MogR variant mutated in two amino acids within the putative DNA binding domain restored phenotypes to those of an empty vector control. In accordance, introduction of these mutations resulted in complete loss in MogR binding to its candidate flagellar locus target site in vitro. In contrast to L. monocytogenes, MogR appears to be regulated in a growth-phase dependent and temperature-independent manner in B. thuringiensis 407. Interestingly, mogR was found to be conserved also in non-motile B. cereus group species such as B. mycoides and B. pseudomycoides, which both carry major gene deletions in the flagellar motility locus and where in B. pseudomycoides mogR is the only gene retained. Furthermore, mogR is expressed in non-motile B. anthracis. Altogether this provides indications of an expanded set of functions for MogR in B. cereus group species, beyond motility regulation. In conclusion, MogR constitutes a novel B. thuringiensis pleiotropic transcriptional regulator, acting as a repressor of motility genes, and affecting the expression of a variety of additional genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence.},

	abstract = {Bacillus licheniformis can cause foodborne intoxication due to the production of the surfactant lichenysin. The aim of this study was to measure the production of lichenysin by food isolates of B. licheniformis in LB medium and skimmed milk and its cytotoxicity for intestinal cells. Out of 11 B. licheniformis isolates tested, most showed robust growth in high salt (1M NaCl), 4\% ethanol, at 37 or 55°C, and aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All strains produced lichenysin (in varying amounts), but not all strains were hemolytic. Production of this stable compound by selected strains (high producers B4094 and B4123, and type strain DSM13T) was subsequently determined using LB medium and milk, at 37 and 55°C. Lichenysin production in LB broth and milk was not detected at cell densities {\textless} 5 log10 CFU/ml. The highest concentrations were found in the stationary phase of growth. Total production of lichenysin was 4–20 times lower in milk than in LB broth (maximum 36 μg/ml), and ∼10 times lower in the biomass obtained from milk agar than LB agar. Under all conditions tested, strain B4094 consistently yielded the highest amounts. Besides strain variation and medium composition, temperature also had an effect on lichenysin production, with twofold lower amounts of lichenysin produced at 55°C than at 37°C. All three strains produced lichenysin A with varying acyl chain lengths (C11–C18). The relative abundance of the C14 variant was highest in milk and the C15 variant highest in LB. The concentration of lichenysin needed to reduce cell viability by 50\% (IC50) was 16.6 μg/ml for Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells and 16.8 μg/ml for pig ileum organoids. Taken together, the presence of low levels ({\textless}5 log10 CFU/ml) of B. licheniformis in foods is unlikely to pose a foodborne hazard related to lichenysin production. However, depending on the strain present, the composition, and storage condition of the food, a risk of foodborne intoxication may arise if growth to high levels is supported and such product is ingested.},

In prokaryotes, sigma factors recognize the promoters of genes. Activator and repressor proteins control gene expression by positive and negative regulation. Regulatory proteins themselves may be altered, most frequently by addition or removal of phosphate groups. Some regulators control only a handful of genes, whereas global regulators, such as the Crp protein of bacteria, control large numbers of genes. Small signal molecules often regulate genes via binding to regulatory proteins. Some of these are nutrients or metabolites but others are nucleotide derivatives.

Third, in order to rank the chemical hazards, two approaches of aggregation of the three criteria were deployed. On the one hand, a multi-criteria decision analysis outranking method and on the other hand a semi-quantitative risk-matrix type method. We then tested these approaches on follow-on formulae for the 7–12 months population, for which contamination data from the French infant Total Diet study were available. The results of both methods showed that the six prioritised substances are the same even if not in the exact same order (acrylamide, inorganic arsenic, furan, chromium VI, lead and PCDD/Fs) demonstrating the robustness of these approaches.},

Disruption of comQ in the chromosome prevented the development of competence as well as the transcription of comG, a late competence operon.

The aim of the present study was to estimate disability weights for Europe for a set of 255 health states, including 43 new health states, by replicating the GBD 2010 Disability Weights Measurement study among representative population samples from four European countries.},

        , Among the wide variety of viral agents liable to be found as food contaminants, noroviruses and hepatitis A virus are responsible for most well characterized foodborne virus outbreaks. Additionally, hepatitis E virus has emerged as a potential zoonotic threat., Molecular methods, including an ISO standard, are available for norovirus and hepatitis A virus detection in foodstuffs, although the significance of genome copy detection with regard to the associated health risk is yet to be determined through viability assays., More precise and rapid methods for early foodborne outbreak investigation are being developed and they will need to be validated versus the ISO standard. In addition, protocols for next-generation sequencing characterization of outbreak-related samples must be developed, harmonized and validated as well.},

TBEV can be transmitted to humans by ticks as well as by the alimentary route, which is mediated through the consumption of raw milk products from infected ruminants such as sheep, goats, and cows. The alimentary route of TBEV was recognized in the early 1950s and many important experimental studies were performed shortly thereafter. Nowadays, alimentary TBEV infections are recognized as a relevant factor contributing to the overall increase in TBE incidences in Europe. This review aims to summarize the history and current extent of alimentary TBEV infections across Europe, to analyze experimental data on virus secretion in milk, and to review possible alimentary infection preventive measures.},

	issn = {1210-7913},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Analysis of cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) with confirmed food-borne transmission in patients who were unaware of tick attachment prior to the onset of illness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data on laboratory confirmed cases of TBE reported in the Czech Republic (CR) in 1997-2008 were obtained from the EPIDAT system. Patient interview data were recorded in a standardised questionnaire form with multiple choices for locality (GIS) and route of transmission to be exported on a weekly basis in electronic form to a protected database of the Ministry of Health of CR. Statistical processing was conducted by ANOVA using Epi-Info CDC Atlanta and STATCALC software.
RESULTS: TBE has been recognised in CR since 1948 when, for the first time ever in Europe, the TBE virus was isolated from patients and I. ricinus ticks in two Czech and Moravian areas simultaneously (and independently of one another). TBE cases in the Czech Republic have been reported since 1971. In 1997 - 2008 the incidence ranged between 422 cases (1998) to 1029 cases (2006). Food-borne transmission of TBE was first reported in Czechoslovakia in 1954. At that time, nothing was known of the possibilities of arbovirus transmission by the food-borne route; this was discovered following the TBE epidemic of 1951 in the east Slovak town of Roznava in which 660 persons were infected, and of these, 271 were hospitalised. The source of infection was contaminated goats' milk which had been mixed into dairy milk at the local dairy and distributed without pasteurization. The risk of TBE transmission by unpasteurized goats' milk is associated with the current trend of I. ricinus tick proliferation in foothills and mountainous areas. The shift of the line of their spread from 700 m above sea level to 1200 m means that to up to 8\% of the area of the CR (6300 km2) have been newly colonized by ticks. In 1997 - 2008, 64 cases of TBE were recorded in patients who reported consumption of unpasteurized goats' and dairy milk or unpasteurized sheep's milk cheese. The majority of cases involved goats' milk (36 patients, i.e. 56.3\%) and sheep's milk cheese (21 patients, i.e. 32.8\%). Dairy milk-borne infection was responsible for 7 TBE cases (10.9\%). Of the 64 patients with food-borne TBE, 33 were men (51.6\%) and 31 women (48.4\%). Thirty-three cases (51.6\%) occurred in family outbreaks following purchase of cheese or milk from animal breeders. Twenty-two cases (34.4\%) occurred in individual patients and for 9 cases (14.0\%) the data are unavailable. The highest age-specific morbidity, i.e. 1.94/100 000, was observed amongst the 5 - 9 years age-group, while in the adult age-groups the rates ranged between 0.17/100 00 (75+ years) and 0.89/100 00 (35 - 44 years). The comparison of TBE cases in child and adult age groups revealed that children in the food-borne TBE group had a 2.5 fold risk of TBE infection over adults. None of the TBE patients was vaccinated against TBE.
CONCLUSION: In 1997 - 2008, a total of 7288 cases of TBE were reported. Sixty-four (0.9\%) TBE cases were food-borne. In the majority of these cases, TBE virus was transmitted by unpasteurized goats' milk and caused family outbreaks. The deciding factor in these outbreaks was an attempt to provide healthy diet to offspring.},

	abstract = {This report of the EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2020 in 27 EU Member States (MS) and nine non-MS. Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. Two events impacted 2020 MS data collection and related statistics: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2020, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) from 2016 to 2020. Fourteen of the 26 MS reporting data on Salmonella control programmes in poultry met the reduction targets for all poultry categories. Salmonella results for carcases of various species performed by competent authorities were more frequently positive than own-checks conducted by food business operators. This was also the case for Campylobacter quantification results from broiler carcases for the MS group that submitted data from both samplers, whereas overall at EU level, those percentages were comparable. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, with 10-fold less cases reported than salmonellosis, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. Illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases with the highest case fatality. In 2020, 27 MS reported 3,086 foodborne outbreaks (a 47.0\% decrease from 2019) and 20,017 human cases (a 61.3\% decrease). Salmonella remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in ‘eggs and egg products’, norovirus in ‘crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and products containing them’ and L. monocytogenes in ‘fish and fish products’ were the agent/food pairs of most concern. This report also provides updates on tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium caprae, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

The first and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union (EU) trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting MS, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 MS failed meeting at least one. The EU flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the EU and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported confirmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the EU food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in five outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018.

Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. Two events impacted 2020 MS data collection and related statistics: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2020, the ﬁrst and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for conﬁrmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (ﬂat) from 2016 to 2020. Fourteen of the 26 MS reporting data on Salmonella control programmes in poultry met the reduction targets for all poultry categories. Salmonella results for carcases of various species performed by competent authorities were more frequently positive than own-checks conducted by food business operators. This was also the case for Campylobacter quantiﬁcation results from broiler carcases for the MS group that submitted data from both samplers, whereas overall at EU level, those percentages were comparable. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, with 10-fold less cases reported than salmonellosis, followed by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. Illnesses caused by L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases with the highest case fatality. In 2020, 27 MS reported 3,086 foodborne outbreaks (a 47.0\% decrease from 2019) and 20,017 human cases (a 61.3\% decrease). Salmonella remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella in ‘eggs and egg products’, norovirus in ‘crustaceans, shellﬁsh, molluscs and products containing them’ and L. monocytogenes in ‘ﬁsh and ﬁsh products’ were the agent/food pairs of most concern. This report also provides updates on tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium caprae, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

	abstract = {To inform risk management decisions on control and prevention of food-related disease, both the disease burden expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and the cost-of-illness of food-related pathogens are estimated and presented. Disease burden of fourteen pathogens that can be transmitted by food, the environment, animals and humans was previously estimated by Havelaar et al. (2012). In this paper we complement these by cost-of-illness estimates. Together, these present a complete picture of the societal burden of food-related diseases. Using incidence estimates for 2011, community-acquired non-consulting cases, patients consulting their general practitioner, hospitalized patients and the incidence of sequelae and fatal cases, estimates were obtained for DALYs, direct healthcare costs (e.g. costs for doctor's fees, hospitalizations and medicines), direct non-healthcare costs (e.g. travel costs to and from the doctor), indirect non-healthcare costs (e.g. productivity loss, special education) and total costs. The updated disease burden for 2011 was equal to 13,940 DALY/year (undiscounted) or 12,650 DALY/year (discounted at 1.5\%), and was of the same magnitude as previous estimates. At the population-level thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and rotavirus were associated with the highest disease burden. Perinatal listeriosis infection was associated with the highest DALY per symptomatic case. The total cost-of-illness in 2011 of fourteen food-related pathogens and associated sequelae was estimated at € 468 million/year, if undiscounted, and at € 416 million/year if discounted by 4\%. Direct healthcare costs accounted for 24\% of total costs, direct non-healthcare costs for 2\% and indirect non-healthcare costs for 74\% of total costs. At the population-level, norovirus had the highest total cost-of-illness in 2011 with € 106 million/year, followed by thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (€ 76 million/year) and rotavirus (€ 73 million/year). Cost-of-illness per infected case varied from € 150 for Clostridium perfringens intoxications to € 275,000 for perinatal listeriosis. Both incident cases and fatal cases are more strongly correlated with COI/year than with DALY/year. More than 40\% of all cost-of-illness and DALYs can be attributed to food, in total € 168 million/year and 5,150 DALY/year for 2011. Beef, lamb, pork and poultry meat alone accounted for 39\% of these costs. Products of animal origin accounted for € 86 million/year (or 51\% of the costs attributed to food) and 3,320 DALY/year (or 64\% of the disease burden attributed to food). Among the pathogens studied Staphylococcus aureus intoxications accounted for the highest share of costs attributed to food (€ 47.1 million/year), followed by Campylobacter spp. (€ 32.0 million/year) and norovirus (€ 17.7 million/year).},

The first objective of this study was to aggregate the available data in the literature in order to identify and characterise the main microbiological hazards associated with red meat consumption in France. Next, the associated numbers of foodborne illnesses, deaths and the subsequent burden of diseases, expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), were estimated. Using the eight foodborne pathogens kept in the assessment, a probabilistic risk model was built and uncertainty from the data was considered. Campylobacter spp. was ranked as the worst pathogen in terms of the number of human cases associated with red meat consumption, with 210 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 500–520] cases per 100,000 population. The pathogen that induced the highest mortality was non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, with 0.04 [95\% CI = 0.01–0.10] deaths per 100,000 population. These cases were mostly related to pork consumption. However, the major contributor to the number of years in good health lost from red meat consumption in France was hepatitis E, with 33 [95\% CI = 1-64] DALY per 100,000 population; this effect was mainly due to pork liver consumption. In terms of foodborne bacteria, for beef and pork meat, Campylobacter spp., non-typhoidal S. enterica, Clostridium perfringens and shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) represented a mean of 2.2 [95\% CI = 1.0–4.0] DALY per 100,000 individuals per year. The estimations provided in this study might help authorities to focus on these hazards and ultimately reduce their impact on the health of the French population.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was i) to quantify the risk of hepatitis E for Swiss consumers by specified pork products and ii) to estimate the total burden of human food-borne hepatitis E in Switzerland. A quantitative risk assessment from slaughter to consumption was carried out according to the Codex Alimentarius framework. In the hazard characterization, assumptions were made due to the lack of a dose-response relationship for oral exposure to hepatitis E virus (HEV). The prevalence of HEV in 160 pig livers of 40 different Swiss fattening farms was examined and determined to be 1.3\% (CI 0.3\%; 4.4\%). This result was used as input in the risk assessment model, together with data from other published studies. The annual burden of hepatitis E was estimated in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), using data about hepatitis E cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 at two major hospitals located in the canton Ticino. Only the risk of foodborne hepatitis E from products containing pork liver was evaluated, as those containing only pork meat could not be evaluated because of lack of data on HEV load in pork. Assuming that successful oral infection occurs in 1\% of servings contaminated with high HEV loads ({\textgreater}105 genome copies), and that acute illness develops in 5\% of susceptible consumers, the most likely annual number of foodborne hepatitis E cases in Switzerland was estimated to be 1481 (95\% CI 552; 4488) if all products containing pork liver were considered. If only high-risk products, such as plain pork liver and liver sausages (e.g. Saucisse au Foie), were considered, the annual number of cases was estimated to be 176 (95\% CI 64; 498). We were unable to calculate the total burden of hepatitis E in Switzerland due to lack of data. Yet, for the canton Ticino, it was shown that a significant increase had occurred from {\textless}5 DALY per 100,000 inhabitants before 2012 to {\textgreater}50 DALY per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. This change could partly be due to an increased reporting and higher awareness among medical practitioners. Extrapolation to other regions could be accomplished if detailed information on food consumption patterns were available. Notification of HEV cases and attempts of cases source attribution would improve the basis for risk assessments.},

	abstract = {Background
The Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) was established in 2007 by the World Health Organization to estimate the global burden of foodborne diseases (FBDs). This paper describes the methodological framework developed by FERG's Computational Task Force to transform epidemiological information into FBD burden estimates.
Methods and Findings
The global and regional burden of 31 FBDs was quantified, along with limited estimates for 5 other FBDs, using Disability-Adjusted Life Years in a hazard- and incidence-based approach. To accomplish this task, the following workflow was defined: outline of disease models and collection of epidemiological data; design and completion of a database template; development of an imputation model; identification of disability weights; probabilistic burden assessment; and estimating the proportion of the disease burden by each hazard that is attributable to exposure by food (i.e., source attribution). All computations were performed in R and the different functions were compiled in the R package 'FERG'. Traceability and transparency were ensured by sharing results and methods in an interactive way with all FERG members throughout the process.
Conclusions
We developed a comprehensive framework for estimating the global burden of FBDs, in which methodological simplicity and transparency were key elements. All the tools developed have been made available and can be translated into a user-friendly national toolkit for studying and monitoring food safety at the local level.},

Both incident cases and fatal cases are more strongly correlated with COI/year than with DALY/year. More than 40\% of all cost-of-illness and DALYs can be attributed to food, in total € 168 million/year and5,150 DALY/year for 2011. Beef, lamb, pork and poultry meat alone accounted for 39\% of these costs. Products of animal origin accounted for € 86 million/year (or 51\% of the costs attributed to food) and3,320 DALY/year (or 64\% of the disease burden attributed to food). Among the pathogens studied Staphylococcus aureus intoxications accounted for the highest share of costs attributed to food (€ 47.1 million/year), followed by Campylobacter spp. (€ 32.0 million/year) and norovirus (€ 17.7 million/year).},

These seven pathogens accounted for 268,372 cases, 98 deaths, and 3121 DALYs, and led to a total expenditure of 434 million Euro in 1 year in a country with 5.8 million citizens. Foodborne infections by Campylobacter, Salmonella, and norovirus caused the most DALYs, whereas Campylobacter, and norovirus and STEC had the higher costs.

	abstract = {To inform risk management decisions on control, prevention and surveillance of foodborne disease, the disease burden of foodborne pathogens is estimated using Disability Adjusted Life Years as a summary metric of public health. Fourteen pathogens that can be transmitted by food are included in the study (four infectious bacteria, three toxin-producing bacteria, four viruses and three protozoa). Data represent the burden in the Netherlands in 2009. The incidence of community-acquired non-consulting cases, patients consulting their general practitioner, those admitted to hospital, as well as the incidence of sequelae and fatal cases is estimated using surveillance data, cohort studies and published data. Disease burden includes estimates of duration and disability weights for non-fatal cases and loss of statistical life expectancy for fatal cases. Results at pathogen level are combined with data from an expert survey to assess the fraction of cases attributable to food, and the main food groups contributing to transmission. Among 1.8 million cases of disease (approx. 10,600 per 100,000) and 233 deaths (1.4 per 100,000) by these fourteen pathogens, approximately one-third (680,000 cases; 4100 per 100,000) and 78 deaths (0.5 per 100,000) are attributable to foodborne transmission. The total burden is 13,500 DALY (82 DALY per 100,000). On a population level, Toxoplasma gondii, thermophilic Campylobacter spp., rotaviruses, noroviruses and Salmonella spp. cause the highest disease burden. The burden per case is highest for perinatal listeriosis and congenital toxoplasmosis. Approximately 45\% of the total burden is attributed to food. T. gondii and Campylobacter spp. appear to be key targets for additional intervention efforts, with a focus on food and environmental pathways. The ranking of foodborne pathogens based on burden is very different compared to when only incidence is considered. The burden of acute disease is a relatively small part of the total burden. In the Netherlands, the burden of foodborne pathogens is similar to the burden of upper respiratory and urinary tract infections.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the public health significance of hemolytic Aeromonas species isolated from 213 food samples in Egypt, based on their virulence and antimicrobial-resistance potential. We recovered 63 strains, isolated from fish, raw milk, karish cheeses, and ras cheese in 29 (31.18\%) of 93, 10 (25.00\%) of 40, 13 (32.50\%) of 40, and 11 (27.50\%) of 40 samples, respectively. The most prevalent virulence gene was alt (50.79\%), followed by aerA (34.92\%), asa1 (39.68\%), ahh1 (20.63\%), act (11.11\%), and ast (3.17\%). Thirteen strains screened in this study carried no hemolysin gene, but only the alt gene, and another eight hemolytic strains screened, carried no virulence gene. The virulence signatures “ahh1+aerA” and “alt+act,” in which the genes interact synergistically to induce severe diarrhea, were detected in two and four strains, respectively. Most showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and imipenem, which indicates the complexity of the β-lactamase production in our hemolytic Aeromonas strains. Fourteen (22.22\%) of 63 strains carried one or more antimicrobial-resistance markers, including the blaCTX-M, blaTEM, tet(A), tet(E), and intI1 genes, which were detected in 6.34, 3.17, 3.17, 4.76, and 14.28\% of isolates, respectively. In conclusion, the majority of hemolytic Aeromonas strains isolated from the intestinal contents of healthy fish and naturally contaminated milk and cheeses were not commensal but had developed multidrug-resistance and virulence profiles, indicating an emerging potential health risk. Importantly, screening for certain hemolysin genes may not be reliable in predicting the pathogenic potential of Aeromonas species and, thereby, the safety of analyzed foods. Our findings indicate that specific criteria are required for the phenotypic and molecular analysis of Aeromonas species in food items, particularly those eaten without further treatment, to ensure their safety.},

Iodine levels were higher in samples containing seaweed, while iAs concentrations were greater in rice-containing sushi. In turn, total Hg and MeHg were significantly higher in sushi samples with tuna. Health risks of sushi consumption were assessed for three population groups: children, adolescents and adults. Considering an average intake of 8 sushi pieces for adults and adolescents, and 3 sushi pieces for children, the estimated exposure to MeHg by adolescents exceeded the tolerable daily intake set by EFSA, while MeHg intake by children and adults was below, but close to that threshold. A relatively high daily exposure of Ni and Pb was also found, especially for adolescents. Since this study focused only on the consumption of sushi, the contribution of other food groups to the overall dietary exposure should not be disregarded. It might lead to an exposure to MeHg and other trace elements above the health-based guideline values.},

A new approach is necessary to control Ov infection because people easily get re-infected even after taking praziquantel unless they change their behaviors. This study aimed to explore factors associated with Ov infection among children and to identify the existing behaviors and perception that might contribute to the control of Ov infection in Lao PDR. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Yommalath district, Khammouane province, in Lao PDR in August and September 2015. In this cross-sectional study, we used a semi-structured questionnaire and interviewed 348 mothers who had a child aged 5–15 years.

	abstract = {Many of the chronic illnesses that plague modern society derive in large part from poor food choices. Thus, it is not surprising that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, aimed at the population ≥2 y of age, recommends limiting consumption of salt, fat, and simple sugars, all of which have sensory properties that we humans find particularly palatable, and increasing the variety and contribution of fruits and vegetables in the diet, to promote health and prevent disease. Similar recommendations may soon be targeted at even younger Americans: the B-24 Project, led by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA, is currently evaluating evidence to include infants and children from birth to 2 y of age in the dietary guidelines. This article reviews the underinvestigated behavioral phenomena surrounding how to introduce vegetables and fruits into infants’ diets, for which there is much medical lore but, to our knowledge, little evidence-based research. Because the chemical senses are the major determinants of whether young children will accept a food (e.g., they eat only what they like), these senses take on even greater importance in understanding the bases for food choices in children. We focus on early life, in contrast with many other studies that attempt to modify food habits in older children and thus may miss sensitive periods that modulate long-term acceptance. Our review also takes into consideration ontogeny and sources of individual differences in taste perception, in particular, the role of genetic variation in bitter taste perception.},

Intercultural differences in vegetable preferences and consumption habits were found. Mothers across all groups agreed on the importance of children's vegetable consumption, the influence that mothers have over their children's vegetable intake, and how challenging it is to get children to eat a variety of vegetables. The ethnic groups differed regarding how they perceived the level of mothers' responsibility over children's vegetable intake, the way that mothers defined the amount of vegetables that children should eat, the constraints that mothers had on increasing their children's vegetable intake and mothers' recommendations to encourage vegetable consumption. Our study suggests that under similar socio-economic and parental education levels, culture-specific strategies should be considered to foster healthy dietary habits in children.},

	abstract = {Consumption of fruits and vegetables can be examined at two levels: overall consumption of fruits and vegetables as a category or the specific types of fruit and vegetables (or varieties thereof) that are preferred within the category. Overall consumption is dictated by a complex combination of both external factors (e.g., access, quality) and internal (i.e., psychological) factors. While external factors are an important gatekeeper to fruit and vegetable consumption, internal factors such as motivation and enjoyment are critical for sustained adequate consumption levels that will contribute to maintaining health in the long-term. Enjoyment is intimately linked to fruit and vegetable quality and thus features of fruits and vegetables that contribute to perceived quality, and therefore consumer preferences and purchasing behavior within the produce category, must also be examined. Quality can be divided into two categories including consumption quality cues (appearance, taste, and texture) and purchase quality cues (e.g., organic, local, genetic engineering status, waste reduction features, and packaging). A great deal of research has been completed to elucidate the consumption and purchase qualities that impact consumer preference. However, consumer preferences are not static over time. As market availability and consumer familiarity changes over time, this will lead to changes in consumer habits and preferences. Therefore, consumer perception of quality must be periodically reexamined and postharvest practices must be adapted over time to continue to align with consumer quality expectations and contribute to continued produce enjoyment and consumption.},

Between 45 degrees C and 64 degrees C, the lethality of the combined process (MTS) was higher than expected if heat and ultrasound under pressure processes acted simultaneously but independently, that is, a synergistic effect was observed. The maximum synergistic effect (38.2\%) was found at 54 degrees C. Recovery on selective media - with sodium chloride or bile salts - revealed that a certain proportion of the survivors after MTS treatments were sublethally injured. It was also observed that survivors after MTS treatments progressively died during refrigerated storage (up to 96 h at 4 degrees C) in the apple juice.

Surviving microbes were enumerated using standard plate counting methods. For raw milk, and HPP-treated and HoP-treated milk, the immunoreactivity of an array of bioactive proteins was assessed via ELISA and the activity of bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL) was determined via a colorimetric substrate assay.Results: Treatment at 500 MPa for 9 min resulted in {\textgreater}5-log reductions of all vegetative bacteria, but {\textless}1-log reduction in B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spores. HoP decreased immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G, lactoferrin, elastase and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) concentrations, and BSSL activity. The treatment at 500 MPa for 9 min preserved more IgA, IgM, elastase, lactoferrin, PIGR, and BSSL than HoP. HoP and HPP treatments up to 500 MPa for 9 min caused no losses in osteopontin, lysozyme, alpha-lactalbumin and vascular endothelial growth factor.Conclusion: Compared with HoP, HPP at 500 MPa for 9 min provides {\textgreater}5-log reduction of tested vegetative neonatal pathogens with improved retention of IgA, IgM, lactoferrin, elastase, PIGR, and BSSL in human milk.},

The survival of Cronobacter spp. was assayed, as were any changes in the quality of the treated PIF. Inactivation of Cronobacter spp. by SC-CO2 was enhanced as temperature and pressure conditions increased ({\textgreater}6.32 log(10) cfu/g). In a validation assay using low-level inoculation (3.21 log(10) cfu/g), treatment at 73 degrees C and 15 MPa for 30 min, 20 MPa for 20 and 30 min, or 25 MPa for 20 and 30 min reduced Cronobacter spp. to undetectable levels, with no recovery of cell viability. There was no significant change in water activity, pH, and color of the treated PIF. Overall, the optimum conditions for elimination of Cronobacter spp. were determined to be 73 degrees C and 20 MPa for 20 min. These parameters for effective SC-CO2 treatment are feasibly applicable to end product of dehydrated PIF. The results of our study may contribute to the development of an efficient method for improving the microbiological safety of PIF.},

Significant differences in inactivation of C. sakazakii were observed in milk samples under different pressures for 3 to 7 min compared with untreated samples, and C. sakazakii was not detected after 400 MPa for 3 min. The lethality rates of C. sakazakii cells in whole and skim milk with an initial level of 10(4) cfu/mL after 100 and 200 MPa treatments were not significantly different, but relatively higher lethality rates were found in whole milk after 300 MPa treatment than in skim milk. Finally, the scanning electron micrographs indicated that cellular envelope and intracellular damage of C. sakazakii cells were apparent after 300 and 400 MPa for 5.0 min compared with the untreated cells, and a progressive increase of injured cells with increased pressure treatment was found. It was concluded that C. sakazakii was sensitive to highpressure processing treatment and that high-pressure processing treatment with 400 MPa for 3.0 min can be used to control C. sakazakii contamination in milk samples.},

The safety of food products is, however, not always insured and the different steps in the processing of food involve physiological and metabolic changes in bacteria. Among these changes, virulence properties may also be affected. In this study, the effect of drying and successive thermal treatments on the invasion capacity of Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Senftenberg, and Cronobacter sakazakii was assessed. Bacteria were dried on milk powder at three different water activity levels (0.25, 0.58, and 0.80) and heated at two different temperatures (90 degrees C and 100 degrees C) for 30 and 120 s. After recovery, stressed bacterial populations were placed in contact with Caco-2 cells to estimate their invasion capacity. Our results show that drying increases the invasion capacity of foodborne pathogens, but that heat treatment in the dried state did not exert a selective pressure on bacterial cells depending on their invasion capacity after drying. Taken together, our findings add to the sum of knowledge on food safety in dried food products and provide insight into the effects of food processing.},

	abstract = {The inactivation of Cronobacter sakazakii by heat and ultrasound treatments under pressure at different temperatures [manosonication (MS) and manothermosonication (MTS)] was studied in citrate-phosphate pH 7.0 buffer and rehydrated powdered milk. The inactivation rate was an exponential function of the treatment time for MS/MTS treatments (35-68 degrees C; 200 kPa of pressure; 117 mu m of amplitude of ultrasonic waves) in both media, and for thermal treatments alone when buffer was used as heating media. Survival curves of C. sakazakii during heating in milk had a concave downward profile. Up to 50 degrees C, the lethality of ultrasound under pressure treatments was independent of the treatment temperature in both media. At temperatures greater than 64 degrees C in buffer and 68 degrees C in milk, the inactivating effect of MTS was equivalent to that of the thermal treatments alone at the same temperature. Between 50 and 64 degrees C for buffer and 50 and 68 degrees C for milk, the lethality of MTS was the result of a synergistic effect, where the total lethal effect was higher than the lethal effect of heat added to that of ultrasound under pressure at room temperature. The maximum synergism was found at 60 degrees C in buffer and at 56 degrees C in milk. A heat treatment of 12 min (60 degrees C) or 4 min of an ultrasound under pressure at room temperature treatment (35 degrees C; 200 kPa; 117 mu m) would be necessary to guarantee the death of 99.99\% of C. sakazakii cells suspended in milk. The same level of C. sakazakii inactivation can be achieved with 1.8 min of a MTS treatment (60 degrees C; 200 kPa; 117 mu m).

The modeling procedure is based on a previous model (S. Koseki and K. Yamamoto, Int. J. Food Microbiol. 116: 136-143, 2007) that describes the probability of death of bacteria. The model developed in this study consists of a total of 300 combinations of pressure (400, 450, 500, 550, or 600 MPa), pressure-holding time (1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 min), temperature (25 or 40 degrees C), inoculum level (3, 5, or 7 log(10) CFU/ml), and medium (TSB or IF), with each combination tested in triplicate. For each replicate response of E. sakazakii, survival and death were scored with values of 0 and 1, respectively. Data were fitted to a logistic regression model in which the medium was treated as a dummy variable. The model predicted that the required pressure-holding times at 500 MPa for a 5-log reduction in IF with 90\% achievement probability were 26.3 and 7.9 min at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The probabilities of achieving 5-log reductions in TSB and IF by treatment with 400 MPa at 25 degrees C for 10 min were 92 and 3\%, respectively. The model enabled the identification of a minimum processing condition for a required log reduction, regardless of the underlying inactivation kinetics pattern. Simultaneously, the probability of an inactivation effect under the predicted processing condition was also provided by taking into account the environmental factors mentioned above.},

	abstract = {Parasites are important food-borne pathogens. Their complex lifecycles, varied transmission routes, and prolonged periods between infection and symptoms mean that the public health burden and relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Furthermore, there are challenges in detection and diagnostics, and variations in reporting. A Europe-focused ranking exercise, using multicriteria decision analysis, identified potentially food-borne parasites of importance, and that are currently not routinely controlled in food. These are Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Echinococcus spp. Infection with these parasites in humans and animals, or their occurrence in food, is not notifiable in all Member States. This Opinion reviews current methods for detection, identification and tracing of these parasites in relevant foods, reviews literature on food-borne pathways, examines information on their occurrence and persistence in foods, and investigates possible control measures along the food chain. The differences between these three parasites are substantial, but for all there is a paucity of well-established, standardised, validated methods that can be applied across the range of relevant foods. Furthermore, the prolonged period between infection and clinical symptoms (from several days for Cryptosporidium to years for Echinococcus spp.) means that source attribution studies are very difficult. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the domestic animal lifecycle (involving dogs and livestock) for Echinoccocus granulosus means that this parasite is controllable. For Echinococcus multilocularis, for which the lifecycle involves wildlife (foxes and rodents), control would be expensive and complicated, but could be achieved in targeted areas with sufficient commitment and resources. Quantitative risk assessments have been described for Toxoplasma in meat. However, for T. gondii and Cryptosporidium as faecal contaminants, development of validated detection methods, including survival/infectivity assays and consensus molecular typing protocols, are required for the development of quantitative risk assessments and efficient control measures.},

The HPP inactivation of foodborne viruses in foods depends on high-pressure processing parameters (pressure, temperature, and duration time) or non-processing parameters such as virus type, food matrix, water activity (aw), and the pH of foods. HPP was found to be effective for the inactivation of foodborne viruses such as HuNoV, HAV, HAstV, and HuAdV in foods. HPP treatments have been found to be effective at eliminating foodborne viruses in high-risk foods such as shellfish and vegetables.

	abstract = {High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal treatment in which, for microbial inactivation, foods are subjected to isostatic pressures (P) of 400–600 MPa with common holding times (t) from 1.5 to 6 min. The main factors that influence the efficacy (log10 reduction of vegetative microorganisms) of HPP when applied to foodstuffs are intrinsic (e.g. water activity and pH), extrinsic (P and t) and microorganism-related (type, taxonomic unit, strain and physiological state). It was concluded that HPP of food will not present any additional microbial or chemical food safety concerns when compared to other routinely applied treatments (e.g. pasteurisation). Pathogen reductions in milk/colostrum caused by the current HPP conditions applied by the industry are lower than those achieved by the legal requirements for thermal pasteurisation. However, HPP minimum requirements (P/t combinations) could be identified to achieve specific log10 reductions of relevant hazards based on performance criteria (PC) proposed by international standard agencies (5–8 log10 reductions). The most stringent HPP conditions used industrially (600 MPa, 6 min) would achieve the above-mentioned PC, except for Staphylococcus aureus. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the endogenous milk enzyme that is widely used to verify adequate thermal pasteurisation of cows’ milk, is relatively pressure resistant and its use would be limited to that of an overprocessing indicator. Current data are not robust enough to support the proposal of an appropriate indicator to verify the efficacy of HPP under the current HPP conditions applied by the industry. Minimum HPP requirements to reduce Listeria monocytogenes levels by specific log10 reductions could be identified when HPP is applied to ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked meat products, but not for other types of RTE foods. These identified minimum requirements would result in the inactivation of other relevant pathogens (Salmonella and Escherichia coli) in these RTE foods to a similar or higher extent.},

	abstract = {High hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) is a mild preservation technique, and its use for processing foods has been widely documented in the literature. However, very few quantitative synthesis studies have been conducted to gather and analyze bacterial inactivation data to identify the mechanisms of HPP-induced bacterial inactivation. The purpose of this study was to conduct a quantitative analysis of three-decimal reduction times (t3δ) from a large set of existing studies to determine the main influencing factors of HPP-induced inactivation of three foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica) in various foods. Inactivation kinetics data sets from 1995 to 2017 were selected, and t3δ values were first estimated by using the nonlinear Weibull model. Bayesian inference was then used within a metaregression analysis to build and test several models and submodels. The best model (lowest error and most parsimonious) was a hierarchical mixed-effects model including pressure intensity, temperature, study, pH, species, and strain as explicative variables and significant factors. Values for t3δ and ZP associated with inactivation under HPP were estimated for each bacterial pathogen, with their associated variability. Interstudy variability explained most of the variability in t3δ values. Strain variability was also important and exceeded interstudy variability for S. aureus, which prevented the development of an overall model for this pathogen. Meta-analysis is not often used in food microbiology but was a valuable quantitative tool for modeling inactivation of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella in response to HPP treatment. Results of this study could be useful for refining quantitative assessment of the effects of HPP on vegetative foodborne pathogens or for more precisely designing costly and labor-intensive experiments with foodborne pathogens.
HIGHLIGHTS
A meta-analysis was performed to identify factors influencing HPP inactivation of pathogens.Three-decimal reduction times following HPP were estimated from existing data.Staphylococcus aureus is the most piezoresistant of the three pathogens studied.These three foodborne pathogens are less HPP resistant in acidic products.},

	abstract = {The last two decades saw a steady increase of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) used for treatment of foods. Although the science of biomaterials exposed to high pressure started more than a century ago, there still seem to be a number of unanswered questions regarding safety of foods processed using HHP. This review gives an overview on historical development and fundamental aspects of HHP, as well as on potential risks associated with HHP food applications based on available literature. Beside the combination of pressure and temperature, as major factors impacting inactivation of vegetative bacterial cells, bacterial endospores, viruses, and parasites, factors, such as food matrix, water content, presence of dissolved substances, and pH value, also have significant influence on their inactivation by pressure. As a result, pressure treatment of foods should be considered for specific food groups and in accordance with their specific chemical and physical properties. The pressure necessary for inactivation of viruses is in many instances slightly lower than that for vegetative bacterial cells; however, data for food relevant human virus types are missing due to the lack of methods for determining their infectivity. Parasites can be inactivated by comparatively lower pressure than vegetative bacterial cells. The degrees to which chemical reactions progress under pressure treatments are different to those of conventional thermal processes, for example, HHP leads to lower amounts of acrylamide and furan. Additionally, the formation of new unknown or unexpected substances has not yet been observed. To date, no safety-relevant chemical changes have been described for foods treated by HHP. Based on existing sensitization to non-HHP-treated food, the allergenic potential of HHP-treated food is more likely to be equivalent to untreated food. Initial findings on changes in packaging materials under HHP have not yet been adequately supported by scientific data.},

We used next-generation sequencing (NGS), digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH), and average nucleotide identity (ANI) to investigate the relationship between these species. The type strains of Mycobacterium africanum , Mycobacterium bovis , Mycobacterium caprae , Mycobacterium microti and Mycobacterium pinnipedii were sequenced via NGS. Pairwise dDDH and ANI comparisons between these, previously sequenced MTBC type strain genomes (including ‘Mycobacterium canettii’, ‘Mycobacterium mungi’ and ‘Mycobacterium orygis’) and M. tuberculosis H37RvT were performed. Further, all available genome sequences in GenBank for species in or putatively in the MTBC were compared to H37RvT. Pairwise results indicated that all of the type strains of the species are extremely closely related to each other (dDDH: 91.2–99.2 \%, ANI: 99.21–99.92 \%), greatly exceeding the respective species delineation thresholds, thus indicating that they belong to the same species. Results from the GenBank genomes indicate that all the strains examined are within the circumscription of H37RvT (dDDH: 83.5–100 \%). We, therefore, formally propose a union of the species of the MTBC as M. tuberculosis . M. africanum , M. bovis , M. caprae , M. microti and M. pinnipedii are reclassified as later heterotypic synonyms of M. tuberculosis . ‘M. canettii’, ‘M. mungi’, and ‘M. orygis’ are classified as strains of the species M. tuberculosis . We further recommend use of the infrasubspecific term ‘variant’ (‘var.’) and infrasubspecific designations that generally retain the historical nomenclature associated with the groups or otherwise convey such characteristics, e.g. M. tuberculosis var. bovis.},

In order to prevent illness, product contamination at manufacture and during preparation, as well as growth after reconstitution, must be minimized by appropriate control measures. In this publication, several determinants of the growth of E. sakazakii in reconstituted infant formula are reported. The following key growth parameters were determined: lag time, specific growth rate, and maximum population density. Cells were harvested at different phases of growth and spiked into powdered infant formula. After reconstitution in sterile water, E. sakazakii was able to grow at temperatures between 8 and 47°C. The estimated optimal growth temperature was 39.4°C, whereas the optimal specific growth rate was 2.31 h−1. The effect of temperature on the specific growth rate was described with two secondary growth models. The resulting minimum and maximum temperatures estimated with the secondary Rosso equation were 3.6°C and 47.6°C, respectively. The estimated lag time varied from 83.3 ± 18.7 h at 10°C to 1.73 ± 0.43 h at 37°C and could be described with the hyperbolic model and reciprocal square root relation. Cells harvested at different phases of growth did not exhibit significant differences in either specific growth rate or lag time. Strains did not have different lag times, and lag times were short given that the cells had spent several (3 to 10) days in dry powdered infant formula. The growth rates and lag times at various temperatures obtained in this study may help in calculations of the period for which reconstituted infant formula can be stored at a specific temperature without detrimental impact on health.},

	abstract = {The inactivation rate of foodborne microorganisms under high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is influenced by factors such as substrate, species, strain, temperature, pH, and stage of growth of the cell. In this study, 445 DP-values from previously published data were analyzed, including those from bacterial spores, vegetative cells, and yeasts. Three secondary linear inactivation models with pressure and/or temperature as process parameters were tested to estimate global log DP-, zP-, and zT-values, and the influence of these parameters and additional factors was assessed. The results show that significant differences in microbial resistance are mainly the result of temperature, highlighting the need for its inclusion as a process parameter. Perhaps due to the large number of data and very distinct factors, the remaining factors showed no significant differences in microbial resistance, except in the case of Clostridium spp. in soy milk, which showed decreased resistance in this substrate compared with its behavior in other products. These results serve to establish priorities among factors influencing HHP inactivation and to estimate global kinetic parameters as a basis for setting target levels of inactivation. Moreover, they can be used as a benchmark for comparison of microbial HHP inactivation data gathered in future studies.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is mainly linked to the consumption of raw milk from infected cows. In many countries, cases are rare, due to pasteurisation of milk and national programmes to control M. bovis infection in cattle. Speciality cheeses, which are often produced using raw milk, present challenges to risk managers in countries where M. bovis is endemic or (re-) emerging. A key concern is the potential risk of zoonotic transmission of M. bovis via the consumption of dairy products produced using raw milk originating from herds infected with M. bovis (bovine tuberculosis, bTB). The aim of this study was to determine parameter estimates to support the future risk assessment of M. bovis in raw milk cheese. In this study, the hazard was identified as viable M. bovis organisms in raw milk cheese. Parameters of interest in this study related to exposure assessment (the estimated extent of human exposure to viable M. bovis organisms) and hazard characterisation (the risk posed to human health following exposure to viable M. bovis organisms). The pathway for exposure assessment was visualised using a conceptual framework, which describes the steps through which M. bovis may be transferred from an infected animal(s) through manufacturing to the final cheese product. Estimation of most parameters for exposure assessment and hazard characterisation was undertaken using systematic literature reviews. Estimates could be derived for many parameters, but not all. In particular, the number of M. bovis organisms excreted in the milk and present in the faeces of infected cattle are unknown. There is zero-tolerance for M. bovis in foods of animal origin destined for human consumption in European legislation. This work has highlighted important gaps in knowledge, and areas for further research. For each of the parameters for which estimates are available, we outline the types/sources of uncertainty as reflected in relevant published papers. In any future application of these parameter estimates, care will be needed to reflect the uncertainties associated with these elements of exposure assessment.},

	abstract = {Development of science-based interventions in raw milk cheese production is challenging due to the large diversity of production procedures and final products. Without an agreed upon categorization scheme, science-based food safety evaluations and validation of preventive controls would have to be completed separately on each individual cheese product, which is not feasible considering the large diversity of products and the typically small scale of production. Thus, a need exists to systematically group raw milk cheeses into logically agreed upon categories to be used for food safety evaluations. This paper proposes and outlines one such categorization scheme that provides for 30 general categories of cheese. As a base for this systematization and categorization of raw milk cheese, we used Table B of the US Food and Drug Administration’s 2013 Food Code, which represents the interaction of pH and water activity for control of vegetative cells and spores in non-heat-treated food. Building on this table, we defined a set of more granular pH and water activity categories to better represent the pH and water activity range of different raw milk cheeses. The resulting categorization scheme was effectively validated using pH and water activity values determined for 273 different cheese samples collected in the marketplace throughout New York State, indicating the distribution of commercially available cheeses among the categories proposed here. This consensus categorization of cheese provides a foundation for a feasible approach to developing science-based solutions to assure compliance of the cheese processors with food safety regulations, such as those required by the US Food Safety Modernization Act. The key purpose of the cheese categorization proposed here is to facilitate product assessment for food safety risks and provide scientifically validated guidance on effective interventions for general cheese categories. Once preventive controls for a given category have been defined, these categories would represent safe havens for cheesemakers, which would allow cheesemakers to safely and legally produce raw milk cheeses that meet appropriate science-based safety requirements (e.g., risk to human health equivalent to pasteurized milk cheeses).},

However, viable mycobacteria have been observed in phagolysosomes during infection of cultured macrophages, and mycobacteria have the virulence determinant MarP, which confers acid resistance in vitro. Here we show in mice and zebrafish that innate macrophages overcome mycobacterial lysosomal avoidance strategies to rapidly deliver a substantial proportion of infecting bacteria to phagolysosomes. Exploiting the optical transparency of the zebrafish, we tracked the fates of individual mycobacteria delivered to phagosomes versus phagolysosomes and discovered that bacteria survive and grow in phagolysosomes, though growth is slower. MarP is required specifically for phagolysosomal survival, making it an important determinant for the establishment of mycobacterial infection in their hosts. Our work suggests that if pathogenic mycobacteria fail to prevent lysosomal trafficking, they tolerate the resulting acidic environment of the phagolysosome to establish infection.},

	abstract = {The range of sodium chloride (salt)-to-moisture ratio is critical in producing high-quality cheese products. The salt-to-moisture ratio has numerous effects on cheese quality, including controlling water activity (aw). Therefore, when attempting to decrease the sodium content of natural cheese it is important to calculate the amount of replacement salts necessary to create the same aw as the full-sodium target (when using the same cheese making procedure). Most attempts to decrease sodium using replacement salts have used concentrations too low to create the equivalent aw due to the differences in the molecular weight of the replacers compared with salt. This could be because of the desire to minimize off-flavors inherent in the replacement salts, but it complicates the ability to conclude that the replacement salts are the cause of off-flavors such as bitter. The objective of this study was to develop a model system that could be used to measure aw directly, without manufacturing cheese, to allow cheese makers to determine the salt and salt replacer concentrations needed to achieve the equivalent aw for their existing full-sodium control formulas. All-purpose flour, salt, and salt replacers (potassium chloride, modified potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride) were blended with butter and water at concentrations that approximated the solids, fat, and moisture contents of typical Cheddar cheese. Salt and salt replacers were applied to the model systems at concentrations predicted by Raoult's law. The aw of the model samples was measured on a water activity meter, and concentrations were adjusted using Raoult's law if they differed from those of the full-sodium model. Based on the results determined using the model system, stirred-curd pilot-scale batches of reduced- and full-sodium Cheddar cheese were manufactured in duplicate. Water activity, pH, and gross composition were measured and evaluated statistically by linear mixed model. The model system method accurately determined the concentrations of salt and salt replacer necessary to achieve the same aw as the full-sodium control in pilot-scale cheese using different replacement salts.},

There have also been several disease outbreaks associated with spices and dried aromatic herbs. An increased concern and attention to the safety of spices and dried aromatic herbs prompted, the Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) to request FAO and WHO to undertake a risk assessment on microbiological hazards in these food commodities.

An expert meeting of the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Meeting on Microbiological Risk Assessment (JEMRA) considered the global evidence on the burden of illness, prevalence and concentration of selected microbial hazards with respect to various spices and dried aromatic herbs, and interventions aimed at controlling them in these commodities. The experts developed the approach to rank the health risks related to the commodity-pathogen combinations, and assessed the performance of the existing Codex sampling plan for Salmonella against several contamination scenarios.},

	abstract = {Foodborne enteric viruses, in particular HuNoV and HAV, are the most common cause of the berry-linked viral diseases, and outbreaks around the world, and have become an important concern for health authorities. Despite the increased importance of berry fruits as a vehicle for foodborne viruses, there is limited information concerning the fate of foodborne viruses in the berry supply chain from farm to consumer. A comprehensive understanding of berry-associated viral outbreaks – with a focus on contamination sources, persistence, survival, and the effects of current postharvest and processing interventions and practices – is essential for the development of effective preventative strategies to reduce risk of illness. The purpose of this paper is twofold; (i) to critically review the published literature on the current state of knowledge regarding berry-associated foodborne viral outbreaks and the efficiency of berry processing practices and (ii) to identify and prioritize research gaps regarding practical and effective mechanism to reduce viral contamination of berries. The review found that fecally infected food handlers were the predominant source of preharvest and postharvest pathogenic viral contamination. Current industrial practices applied to fresh and frozen berries demonstrated limited efficacy for reducing the viral load. While maintaining best practice personal and environmental hygiene is a key intervention, the optimization of processing parameters (i.e., freezing, frozen storage, and washing) and/or development of alternative processing technologies to induce sufficient viral inactivation in berries along with retaining sensory and nutritional quality, is also an important direction for further research.},

	abstract = {A methodology based on the combination of two complementary approaches to rank microbiological risks in foods is presented. In the forward approach data on the pathogenicity of hazards and their behaviour in food during processing and following steps, up to consumption, are used in decision trees to qualitatively estimate the risk associated with foods. In the backward approach risks are evaluated based on the analysis of data available on the past occurrence of hazards and foodborne outbreaks. The categorisation of foods using the forward approach should prevail, and whenever it leads to a likely risk for a given food, the risk can be further qualified with the results from the backward approach. The methodology developed was applied to rank the public health risk posed by certain composite products, which contain both processed products of animal origin and products of plant origin (e.g., bread, cakes, chocolate). Despite limitations in the data available for these foods, valuable results were obtained. The method is therefore considered suitable for application with success to other types of food, and is proposed as a tool for risk managers to rank foods based on their potential food safety risks.},

	abstract = {Thermal inactivation of pathogens has been studied extensively, which has resulted in a wide range of D- and z-values. Estimating the inactivation rate for a specific condition based on these reported values is difficult, since one has to select representative conditions, and data obtained exactly at the required representative conditions are generally not available. Therefore, a first step could be to globally assess a heat treatment taking into account largest effects only. Once the most important parameters are known, a more precise study of inactivation can be performed. Therefore, in this study a large quantity of D-values (n=4066) was collected from literature for various pathogens and linear regression was applied to obtain average D-values (together with the 95\% upper prediction level) and z-values. When comparing these overall data, it can be seen that most factors reported to have an effect on the D-value are smaller than the variability of all published D-values. Even effects of shoulders disappear in the overall analysis. Only a limited number of factors that did have a significant effect (p{\textless}0.05) on the D-value were identified: for Salmonella spp., the presence of chocolate ingredients gave protection to the cells, for Listeria monocytogenes the presence of 10\% salt (or aw{\textless}0.92) resulted in a higher heat resistance, for Bacillus cereus there were significant differences for various strains and in oily products and for Clostridium botulinum there were significant differences in heat resistance between different types of C. botulinum. This does not mean that other effects do not occur, but it shows the main effects that have to be included for a first impression on the performance of a heating process. The obtained 95\% upper prediction levels of the D-values can be used as a (conservative) estimate of inactivation and can be used to give order of magnitude values in overall process evaluations.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment is an important phase of the food production path; it is strictly related to the processing chain as a necessary step for safe foods. This paper represents a contribution to understanding what is and how risk assessment could be conducted; it aims to provide some information on the structure of risk assessment, the tools for its identification and measurement and the importance of risk assessment for correct communication. In this context, after a focus on the background and on some commonly used tools (Risk Ranger, FDA-iRisk, decision tree, among others), the paper describes how to perform risk assessment through three case studies: lettuce (for Listeria monocytogenes), chicken salad (for Escherichia coli), and fresh egg pasta (for Staphylococcus aureus) in the first step, and then a comparison of risk for chicken salad contaminated by different pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella sp.). As a final step, a critical evaluation of Risk Ranger was carried out, pointing out its pros and cons.},

Food safety issues can have widespread impacts beyond public health. They may contribute to, or detract from the achievement of goals in areas including nutrition, food security, food trade and market access, economic and rural development. The risk analysis paradigm guides risk managers to ensure their decisions are based on an assessment of risks to health, and consideration of other factors in choosing the preferred risk management decision. The materials assist decision-makers in applying a multi-factor approach and is applied to two key decision areas – setting food safety priorities, and selecting risk management options. The principles and approaches can be applied to all food safety decisions. Case studies are included as examples of how to apply this decision-making process. Using this guidance will lead to improved food safety decisions, where decision-makers can demonstrate how evidence was used and any trade-offs made. It also facilitates stakeholder engagement, transparency and accountability throughout the decision-making process.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a structured and transparent framework to rank emerging dietary practices. The first challenge was to rank simultaneously biological and chemical hazards using the same criteria whatever the nature of the hazard. For a list of dietary practices selected based on the results of a survey, hazard identification and health effect characterization was carried out. Taking only the top five practices led to the identification of 41 triplets “emerging dietary practice – hazard – health effect”, which highlights the complexity of scoring risk in food safety. A wide variety of hazards, including microbes, parasites, mycotoxins, allergens and other chemical compounds were considered together with a range of health effects such as foodborne pathogen disease, anaphylaxis, cancer, immunosuppression, endocrine disturbance, etc. The second challenge was to develop a framework easy to populate and run. The risk-ranking framework included eight criteria: five to describe the severity, three to describe the likelihood. All of them were informed by literature data and food safety agencies' reports, plus experts’ opinion. The PROMETHEE outranking MCDA technique, available in a R package, was implemented. This risk-ranking framework applied to the results of our small-scale survey revealed that consuming nuts on a regular basis could be the emerging dietary habit presenting the highest-risk score, due to the aflatoxin B1 hazard and its associated health effect (liver cancer). This risk-ranking framework requires however to be applied furthermore in other contexts to evaluate its robustness and identify opportunities for improvement. Once consolidated, this framework will be highly relevant for food safety authorities and policy makers to move forward transparent and evidence-informed decisions.},

In developing approaches to prevent or reduce illnesses from consumption of contaminated produce, new tools are needed to identify and prioritize appropriate efforts. The purpose of this study was to develop a semi-quantitative risk ranking tool (Pathogen-Produce Pair Attribution Risk Ranking Tool, or P3ARRT) to rank the relative public health impact of pathogen-produce commodity combinations, based on explicit data-driven criteria. To identify candidate pathogen-commodity pairs, a database was created that included all published reports of fresh produce-associated outbreaks in the United States. A total risk score was calculated for each pathogen-commodity pair as the summation of nine criteria scores multiplied by the respective criteria weighting. A total of 53 pathogen-produce commodity pairs were included in the risk ranking, and based on scenario and sensitivity analyses, enterohemorrhagic E. coli in leafy greens consistently ranked first, followed by Salmonella spp. in tomatoes, and Salmonella spp. in leafy greens. The P3ARRT model provides a systematic, transparent, and customizable tool with which to prioritize produce pathogen-commodity pairs for further, more rigorous risk assessment modeling and evaluation efforts. The tool is available to the public at www.FoodRisk.org.},

	abstract = {Eight tools relevant to risk ranking of biological hazards in food were identified and assessed using two case studies. Differences in their performance were observed, related to the risk metrics, data requirements, ranking approach, model type, model variables and data integration. Quantitative stochastic models are the most reliable for risk ranking. However, this approach needs good characterisation of input parameters. The use of deterministic models that ignore variability may result in risk ranking errors. The ordinal scoring approaches in semi-quantitative models provide ranking with more errors than the deterministic approaches. FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-iRISK was identified as the most appropriate tool for risk ranking of microbiological hazards. The Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) toolkit can be used in combination with the outputs from FDA-iRISK or as a top-down tool to rank pathogens. Uncertainty needs to be addressed and communicated to decision makers and stakeholders as one of the outcomes of the risk ranking process. Uncertainty and variability can be represented by means of probability distributions. Techniques such as the NUSAP (numeral, unit, spread, assessment and pedigree) approach can also be used to prioritise factors for sensitivity and scenario analysis or stochastic modelling. Quantitative risk ranking models are preferred over semi-quantitative models. When data and time constraints do not allow quantitative risk ranking, semi-quantitative models could be used, but the limitations of these approaches linked to the selection and integration of the ordinal scores should be made explicit. Decision trees should be used only to show how decisions are made about classifying food–pathogen combinations into broad categories. BCoDE and FDA-iRISK, in combination with a network of available predictive microbiology tools, databases and information sources, can form a risk ranking toolbox and be applied based on a “fit for purpose” approach supporting timely and transparent risk ranking.},

	abstract = {Food of non-animal origin (FoNAO) is consumed in a variety of forms, and a major component of almost all meals. These food types have the potential to be associated with large outbreaks as seen in 2011 associated with VTEC O104. A comparison of the incidence of human cases linked to consumption of FoNAO and of food of animal origin (FoAO) was carried out to provide an indication of the proportionality between these two groups of foods. It was concluded that outbreak data reported as part of EU Zoonoses Monitoring is currently the only option for EU-wide comparative estimates. Using this data from 2007 to 2011, FoNAO were associated with 10\% of the outbreaks, 26\% of the cases, 35\% of the hospitalisations and 46\% of the deaths. If the data from the 2011VTEC O104 outbreak is excluded, FoNAO was associated with 10\% of the outbreaks, 18\% of cases, but only 8\% of the hospitalisations and 5\% of the deaths. From 2008 to 2011 there was an increase in the numbers of reported outbreaks, cases, hospitalisations and deaths associated with food of non-animal origin. In order to identify and rank specific food/pathogen combinations most often linked to human cases originating from FoNAO in the EU, a model was developed using seven criteria: strength of associations between food and pathogen based on the foodborne outbreak data from EU Zoonoses Monitoring (2007–11), incidence of illness, burden of disease, dose-response relationship, consumption, prevalence of contamination and pathogen growth potential during shelf life. Shortcomings in the approach using outbreak data were discussed. The top ranking food/pathogen combination was Salmonellaspp. and leafy greens eaten raw followed by (in equal rank) Salmonellaspp. and bulb and stem vegetables, Salmonellaspp. and tomatoes, Salmonellaspp. and melons, and pathogenic Escherichia coli and fresh pods, legumes or grain.},

It concludes that the main factors to be considered are: water activity, pH, temperature and duration of storage, processing, and intensity and duration of other non-thermal physical processes applied. Prevalence and concentration of the pathogens in food are important to determine the risk for consumers. The opinion presents a review of the quantitative microbiology models and databases that can be used to provide quantitative estimations of the impact of the above factors on the survival and growth of the main bacterial pathogens. In composite products, migration and diffusion of moisture and substances among the ingredients may change their physico-chemical parameters, particularly at the interfaces. Therefore, the assessment of the risk posed by composite products needs to consider the combinations of parameters most permissive to survival and growth of pathogens. Two complementary approaches are proposed for the identification and profiling of microbiological hazards in different specific composite products. The first one is based on past outbreaks and prevalence of hazards in the products and leads to the conclusion that the most frequent hazard-composite product combinations are Salmonella in cakes and bakery products. The second one consists in decision tools based on the impact on the pathogens of food composition and food processing. Categorisation of the risk for composite products requires information on their composition, processing and further handling, which can largely differ for foods belonging to the same category. Further conditions may influence the risk and should be verified, i.e. hygienic conditions during preparation of the composite products and their ingredients, shelf-life conditions, and reliability of cooking by consumers to inactivate pathogens. The decision tools developed apply to all composite products considered by the mandate, as well as to all other foods.},

	abstract = {In the absence of epidemiological, microbiological or outbreak data, systematic identification of the hazards and food products posing the higher risk to the consumers is challenging. It is usually in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where the burden of foodborne disease is highest that data tend to be particularly scarce. In this study, we propose qualitative risk-ranking methods for pathogens and food products that can be used in settings where scarcity of data on the frequency/concentration of pathogens in foodstuff is a barrier towards the use of classical risk assessment frameworks. The approach integrates the existing knowledge on foodborne pathogens, manufacturing processes and intrinsic/extrinsic properties of food products with key context-specific information regarding the supply chain(s), characteristics of the Food Business Operators (FBOs) and cultural habits to identify: (i) the pathogens that should be considered as a “High” food safety priority and (ii) the food products posing the higher risk of consumer exposure to microbiological hazards via the oral (ingestion) route. When applied to the dairy sector of Andhra Pradesh (India) as a case study, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and L. monocytogenes were identified as a “High” food safety priority across all FBOs. C. sakazakii was identified as a “High” priority for the FBOs producing infant formula/milk powder whilst Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. a “High” priority when considering the FBOs operating in the unregulated sector. Given the diversity of dairy products considered in the assessment, cluster analysis was used to identify products that shared similar intrinsic/extrinsic features known to drive the microbiological risk. The risk ranking was then done integrating the results of the cluster analysis with context-specific information. Products manufactured/retailed by FBOs in the informal market were considered as posing a “High” risk for the consumers due to a widespread lack of compliance to sanitary regulations. For dairy products produced by FBOs operating in the middle and formal end of the formal-informal spectrum, the risk of consumers exposure to microbiological hazards ranged from “Moderate” to “Extremely low” depending on the FBO and the intrinsic/extrinsic properties of the products. While providing risk estimates of lower precision if compared to data-driven risk assessments, the proposed method maximises the value of the information that can be easily gathered in LMICs and provide informative outputs to support food safety decision-making in contexts where resources to be allocated for prevention of foodborne diseases are limited and the food system is complex.},

The methods were then clustered—based on their characteristics—into eleven method categories. These categories included: risk assessment, comparative risk assessment, risk ratio method, scoring method, cost of illness, health adjusted life years (HALY), multi-criteria decision analysis, risk matrix, flow charts/decision trees, stated preference techniques and expert synthesis. Method categories were described by their characteristics, weaknesses and strengths, data resources, and fields of applications.It was concluded there is no single best method for risk ranking.

	abstract = {The development and use of a simple tool for food safety risk assessment is described. The tool is in spreadsheet software format and embodies established principles of food safety risk assessment, i.e., the combination of probability of exposure to a food-borne hazard, the magnitude of hazard in a food when present, and the probability and severity of outcomes that might arise from that level and frequency of exposure. The tool requires the user to select from qualitative statements and/or to provide quantitative data concerning factors that that will affect the food safety risk to a specific population, arising from a specific food product and specific hazard, during the steps from harvest to consumption. The spreadsheet converts the qualitative inputs into numerical values and combines them with the quantitative inputs in a series of mathematical and logical steps using standard spreadsheet functions. Those calculations are used to generate indices of the public health risk. Shortcomings of the approach are discussed, including the simplifications and assumptions inherent in the mathematical model, the inadequacy of data currently available, and the lack of consideration of variability and uncertainty in the inputs and outputs of the model. Possible improvements are suggested. The model underpinning the tool is a simplification of the harvest to consumption pathway, but the tool offers a quick and simple means of comparing food-borne risks from diverse products, and has utility for ranking and prioritising risks from diverse sources. It can be used to screen food-borne risks and identify those requiring more rigorous assessment. It also serves as an aid to structured problem solving and can help to focus attention on those factors in food production, processing, distribution and meal preparation that most affect food safety risk, and that may be the most appropriate targets for risk management strategies.},

In 2020, France faced a TBEV outbreak linked to the consumption of unpasteurized goat cheese. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a molecular method for the detection of TBEV in raw milk products based on the recent international standard PR ISO/DIS 16140-4. The TBEV recovery rates varied with the inoculation level and settings. The LOD50 and LOD95 of TBEV were 6.40 × 103 genome copies per g or per mL and 2.84 × 104 genome copies per g or per mL, respectively. The percentages of RT-qPCR inhibitions were lower than 75\% and the murine norovirus (MNV-1), used as process control, was detected in all samples with a recovery rate higher than 1\%, as recommended in ISO 15216. We conclude that the described method is appropriate to detect TBEV in raw milk products for routine diagnosis, and to assess potential health risks.},

	abstract = {To inform risk management decisions on control and prevention of food-related disease, both the disease burden expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and the cost-of-illness of food-related pathogens are estimated and presented. Disease burden of fourteen pathogens that can be transmitted by food, the environment, animals and humans was previously estimated by Havelaar et al. (2012). In this paper we complement these by cost-of-illness estimates. Together, these present a complete picture of the societal burden of food-related diseases. Using incidence estimates for 2011, community-acquired non-consulting cases, patients consulting their general practitioner, hospitalized patients and the incidence of sequelae and fatal cases, estimates were obtained for DALYs, direct healthcare costs (e.g. costs for doctor's fees, hospitalizations and medicines), direct non-healthcare costs (e.g. travel costs to and from the doctor), indirect non-healthcare costs (e.g. productivity loss, special education) and total costs. The updated disease burden for 2011 was equal to 13,940 DALY/year (undiscounted) or 12,650 DALY/year (discounted at 1.5\%), and was of the same magnitude as previous estimates. At the population-level thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and rotavirus were associated with the highest disease burden. Perinatal listeriosis infection was associated with the highest DALY per symptomatic case. The total cost-of-illness in 2011 of fourteen food-related pathogens and associated sequelae was estimated at € 468 million/year, if undiscounted, and at € 416 million/year if discounted by 4\%. Direct healthcare costs accounted for 24\% of total costs, direct non-healthcare costs for 2\% and indirect non-healthcare costs for 74\% of total costs. At the population-level, norovirus had the highest total cost-of-illness in 2011 with € 106 million/year, followed by thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (€ 76 million/year) and rotavirus (€ 73 million/year). Cost-of-illness per infected case varied from € 150 for Clostridium perfringens intoxications to € 275,000 for perinatal listeriosis. Both incident cases and fatal cases are more strongly correlated with COI/year than with DALY/year. More than 40\% of all cost-of-illness and DALYs can be attributed to food, in total € 168 million/year and 5,150 DALY/year for 2011. Beef, lamb, pork and poultry meat alone accounted for 39\% of these costs. Products of animal origin accounted for € 86 million/year (or 51\% of the costs attributed to food) and 3,320 DALY/year (or 64\% of the disease burden attributed to food). Among the pathogens studied Staphylococcus aureus intoxications accounted for the highest share of costs attributed to food (€ 47.1 million/year), followed by Campylobacter spp. (€ 32.0 million/year) and norovirus (€ 17.7 million/year).},

	abstract = {This report of the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2018 in 36 European countries (28 Member States (MS) and 8 non-MS). The first and second most commonly reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The European Union (EU) trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable during 2014–2018. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis was at the same level in 2018 as in 2017. Of the 27 reporting MS, 16 met all Salmonella reduction targets for poultry, whereas 11 MS failed meeting at least one. The EU flock prevalence of target Salmonella serovars in breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys decreased during recent years but stalled in breeding turkeys. Salmonella results from Competent Authorities for pig carcasses and for poultry tested through National Control Programmes were more frequently positive compared with food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections in humans were the third most commonly reported zoonosis in the EU and increased from 2014 to 2018. Yersiniosis was the fourth most frequently reported zoonosis in humans in 2018 with a stable trend in 2014–2018. The number of reported confirmed listeriosis cases further increased in 2018, despite Listeria rarely exceeding the EU food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,146 food- and waterborne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella was the most commonly detected agent with S. Enteritidis causing one in five outbreaks. Salmonella in eggs and egg products was the highest risk agent/food pair. A large increase of human West Nile virus infections was reported in 2018. The report further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.},

The pathogen produces different virulence factors including exotoxins, cytotoxins and others. As a psychrotroph, A. hydrophila grow in foods during refrigeration. The disease spectrum associated with this microorganism includes gastroenteritis, septicemia, traumatic and aquatic wound infections, and infections after medical leech therapy. Multiple resistance of the bacterium to many antimicrobials is a fact of high significance. The potential of A. hydrophila to become a foodborne pathogen is a controversial issue.

Abstract Keywords: Aeromonas hydrophila; Emerging Pathogen; Food Borne Disease; Sanitation; Public Health Aeromonas hydrophila is an emerging and re-emerging bacterial foodborne pathogen that can cause life threatening infections. It is ubiquitous in various aquatic environments, and has been considered as a pathogen of fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The organism has been readily isolated from a wide variety of foods, such as fish, eggs, vegetables, sea foods, meat, meat products, milk and milk products. Young children, elderly people and immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of infection. Aeromonas hydrophila infection has been reported from many countries of the world including India. The source of infection is exogenous, and humans can acquire the infection by ingestion of contaminated fish, sea foods, raw milk, raw meat, raw vegetables, and water contaminated with A. hydrophila. Infection can also occur through open wound contamination. The duration of illness may range from 3 days to 6 months. Aeromonas hydrophila is found to be associated with variety of extra-intestinal infections like meningitis, perito-nitis, osteomyelitis, cholangitis, pneumonia, septicemia, cellulitis, myonecrosis, eczema, conjunctivitis, and endophthalmitis. When A. hydrophila crosses the blood-occular barrier to reach the eye via blood stream, it causes a sight-threatening condition known as endogenous endophthalmitis. Most of the infections caused by Aeromonas spp. are gastrointestinal infections and can be easily prevented by maintaining adequate sanitary conditions, such as proper hand hygiene, efficient sewage disposal, and hygienic food preparation. Furthermore, thorough cooking of the food product also minimizes the transmission of infection.},

The first cases of Cyclospora infection were reported in the late 1970s and were observed among expatriates and travelers in regions where infections are endemic. Since then, Cyclospora has been considered a cause of traveler's diarrhea. Epidemiological investigations were reported and examined in areas of endemicity even before the true identity of Cyclospora was elucidated. Cyclospora was fully characterized in the early 1990s, but it was not until the 1995 Cyclospora outbreak in the United States and Canada that it caught the attention of the public and physicians. The biology, clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and control of cyclosporiasis are reviewed, with a focus on diagnostic assays currently being used for clinical and environmental samples. Challenges and limitations in working with Cyclospora are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Cyclospora cayetanensis is a coccidian parasite of humans, with a direct fecal–oral transmission cycle. It is globally distributed and an important cause of foodborne outbreaks of enteric disease in many developed countries, mostly associated with the consumption of contaminated fresh produce. Because oocysts are excreted unsporulated and need to sporulate in the environment, direct person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Infection by C. cayetanensis is remarkably seasonal worldwide, although it varies by geographical regions. Most susceptible populations are children, foreigners, and immunocompromised patients in endemic countries, while in industrialized countries, C. cayetanensis affects people of any age. The risk of infection in developed countries is associated with travel to endemic areas and the domestic consumption of contaminated food, mainly fresh produce imported from endemic regions. Water and soil contaminated with fecal matter may act as a vehicle of transmission for C. cayetanensis infection. The disease is self-limiting in most immunocompetent patients, but it may present as a severe, protracted or chronic diarrhea in some cases, and may colonize extra-intestinal organs in immunocompromised patients. Trimetoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of cyclosporiasis, but relapses may occur. Further research is needed to understand many unknown epidemiological aspects of this parasitic disease. Here, we summarize the biology, epidemiology, outbreaks, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of C. cayetanensis; additionally, we outline future research needs for this parasite.},

We estimated the burden of disease caused by seven foodborne pathogens in Denmark in 2017: Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli, norovirus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Toxoplasma gondii. We used public health surveillance data and scientific literature to estimate incidence, mortality, and total disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of each, and linked results with estimates of the proportion of disease burden that is attributable to foods. Our estimates showed that Campylobacter caused the highest burden of disease, leading to a total burden of 1709 DALYs (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 1665–1755), more than threefold higher than the second highest ranked pathogen (Salmonella: 492 DALYs; 95\% UI 481–504). Campylobacter still led the ranking when excluding DALYs attributable to nonfoodborne routes of exposure. The total estimated incidence was highest for norovirus, but this agent ranked sixth when focusing on foodborne burden. Salmonella ranked second in terms of foodborne burden of disease, followed by Listeria and Yersinia. Foodborne congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated to cause the loss of ∼100 years of healthy life, a burden that was borne by a low number of cases in the population. The ranking of foodborne pathogens varied substantially when based on reported cases, estimated incidence, and burden of disease estimates. Our results reinforce the need to continue food safety efforts throughout the food chain in Denmark, with a particular focus on reducing the incidence of Campylobacter infections.},

Results indicated that the highest mold and yeast counts of 5.6 × 106 colony forming units (cfu) per gram product were found in alfalfa and the lowest (1.0 × 102 cfu/g) were present in ginger supplements. Potentially toxigenic molds were found in alfalfa, coriander, echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, juniper, licorice, psyllium and St. John's wort supplements. The most common fungi were aspergilli, followed by eurotia, penicillia and yeasts. Alternaria alternata, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Rhizopus and Phoma spp. were isolated less frequently. No molds or yeasts were found in synthetic vitamins, minerals, Circu-Care and valerian. Aerobic mesophilic bacteria were isolated from all commodities tested. The highest aerobic plate count numbers (5.2 × 106–3.8 × 107 cfu/g) were recovered from alfalfa, whereas the lowest ({\textless}100–5.5 × 102 cfu/g) were found in vitamins and minerals.

A very critical indicator of safety is the bacteriological and mycological quality of these commodities. The results of this investigation constitute an indicator of mycological/bacteriological contamination of a variety of dietary supplements. Similar testing has not been reported for several of the studied commodities. Therefore, our findings can serve as a basis for future mycological and mycotoxin testing of dietary supplements and eventually for developing guidelines in order to achieve and maintain safe microbial levels in these products.},

	abstract = {Salmonella and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are of serious concern in wheat flour and its related products but little is known on their survival and thermal death kinetics. This study was undertaken to determine their long-term viability and thermal inactivation kinetics in flour. Inoculation was performed using mixtures of EHEC serogroups O45, O121, O145 and Salmonella followed by storage at room temperature (23°C) or 35°C (for Salmonella). Plate counting on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and enrichment were used to assess long-term survival. For thermal studies, wheat flour samples were heated at 55, 60, 65, and 70°C and cell counts of EHEC and Salmonella were determined by plating. The δ-values were calculated using the Weibull model. At room temperature, EHEC serovars and Salmonella were quantifiable for 84 and 112 days, and were detectable for the duration of the experiment after 168 and 365 days, respectively. The δ-values were 2.0, 5.54, and 9.3 days, for EHEC O121, O45, and O145, respectively, and 9.7 days for Salmonella. However, the only significant difference among all values was the δ-value for Salmonella and serogroup O121 (p ≤ 0.05). At 35°C, Salmonella counts declined to unquantifiable levels after a week and were not detected upon enrichment after 98 days. Heat treatment of inoculated wheat flour at 55, 60, 65, and 70°C resulted in δ-value ranges of 20.0–42.9, 4.9–10.0, 2.4–3.2, and 0.2–1.6 min, respectively, for EHEC. The δ-values for Salmonella at those temperatures were 152.2, 40.8, 17.9, and 17.4 min, respectively. The δ-values obtained for Salmonella at each temperature were significantly longer than for EHEC (p ≤ 0.05). Weibull model was a good fit to describe the thermal death kinetics of Salmonella and EHEC O45, O121 and O145 in wheat flour., HIGHLIGHTS
-EHEC and Salmonella can survive for extended periods of time in wheat flour.-Long-term storage inactivation curves of EHEC and Salmonella were similar.-EHEC was more sensitive to heat than Salmonella.-Weibull model was a good fit to describe thermal death kinetics of EHEC and Salmonella.-Flour storage at 35°C may be a feasible method for microbial reduction.},

This baseline testing was performed over the 2006 to 2007 wheat season. Three hundred fifty flour samples were monitored for yeast, mold, and Bacillus cereus, 300 for Escherichia coli, 150 for Salmonella, and 100 for aerobic plate count. Fifty grain samples were analyzed for yeast, mold, E. coli, Salmonella, and B. cereus. There was a single isolation of Salmonella Give in unscreened wheat. The yeast, mold, E. coli, and B. cereus prevalences were 56, 40, 2.0, and 4.0\% for grain and 71, 17, 0.7, and {\textless}0.3\% for flour, respectively. Of the positive samples, the means were 3.7, 2.7, 0.6, and 2.1 for grain, and 3.0, 2.8, and 0.8 log CFU/g for flour. The mean of the aerobic plate count was 4.2 log CFU/g with a 95th percentile count of 4.6 log CFU/g. A microbiological quality baseline of wheat grain and flour from these two Queensland mills has been determined. These data in a specific sense assist the two mills to assess their capacity to meet microbiological criteria, and in a general sense provide at least a limited snapshot of Queensland wheat and flour quality for risk assessments being carried out to evaluate the safety of plant and plant products.},

	abstract = {Production and world consumption of spices are constantly increasing. Although the antimicrobial properties of some spices are well documented, their use in the agri-food industry is also responsible for microbial contamination and spoilage. Bacterial spores introduced by spices can withstand different preparation processes, particularly thermal treatments, leading to food alterations during storage. This review brings together data from the literature about the prevalence and concentrations of spore-forming bacteria in all commercially available spices. The sporeformers found in spices belong mainly to the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Such contaminations are very common and sometimes reach high levels, as in pepper and turmeric. Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus cereus are the most frequently detected species. Studying the harvesting, processing, and storage procedures for spices provides elements to explain why high prevalence and concentrations are observed. Spices are mostly produced in developing countries on small farms using traditional production methods. Spices become contaminated by bacterial spores in two main ways: by contact with soil during harvesting or drying, as for pepper, or by cross-contamination during the water-cooking step, as for turmeric. From these observations, we propose some recommendations. Different methods that can be used to eliminate bacterial spores from spices are presented indicating their efficiency and the limitations of their use.},

Among 24 foodborne parasites ranked by FAO/WHO, 15 are associated with food of non-animal origin (FoNAO). Control of these hazards is essential for food safety.
Scope and approach
Control measures to inactivate parasites in FoNAO are reviewed. Preventing contamination is key to ensuring the safety of fresh produce. However, additional control measures can further reduce the likelihood of occurrence of infectious parasites in FoNAO. Key Findings and Conclusions: The efficacy of treatments depends on parasite species, developmental stage, matrix, and application conditions. Conventional pasteurization (72 °C; 15 s) inactivates parasites in most matrices, although some parasites are more heat resistant, and this may be an inappropriate method for many FoNAO that are intended for eating fresh and raw. Freezing at −20 °C for 2 days inactivates most, but not all, parasites, and some are highly resistant to freezing. Parasites generally survive chemical disinfection, making its application at effective doses often unsuitable at an industrial scale. Ozone and chlorine dioxide are the most promising in terms of efficacy and dosage, nevertheless challenges remain in their application especially for the most fragile produce. High-pressure processing is an efficient technology, providing good inactivation of parasites. Further research should focus on standardizing experimental approaches for evaluation of inactivation techniques and development of methods to measure parasite inactivation in food matrices.},

It is usually acquired by ingestion of water contaminated with oocysts from the feces of infected cats or by the ingestion of raw or undercooked foodstuff containing tissue cysts. The oocyst can contaminate irrigation water and fresh edible produce. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the human population worldwide harbor this parasite. Infection with T. gondii is an important cause of diseases of the central nervous system and the eye in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals.

One third of parasitic outbreaks with known source in the US are attributable to food of animal origin (FoAO). Among 24 foodborne parasites ranked by FAO/WHO, 14 are associated with FoAO. Management of these biological hazards is essential for food safety.
Scope and approach
Control measures to inactivate the 12 most relevant parasites in FoAO are evaluated, including cooking, freezing, curing, and traditionally applied food-processing techniques, as well as high-pressure treatment and irradiation.
Key findings and conclusions
How inactivation is determined may affect results, however efficacy of freezing and heating depends on parasite species and developmental stage, as well as temperature and time conditions. Cooking at core temperature 60–75 °C for 15–30 min inactivates parasites in most matrices. Freezing at −21 °C for 1–7 days generally inactivates parasites in FoAO, but cannot be relied upon in home situations. Parasitic stages are sensitive to 2–5\% NaCl, often augmented by lowering pH. Gamma irradiation at {\textgreater}0.1–0.5 kGy is effective for fish parasites, except Anisakis (10 kGy); {\textgreater}0.4–6.5 kGy control meatborne parasites. More research is needed to investigate and improve irradiation technologies using sustainable energy sources. Literature data are diverse and insufficient to model survival as response to treatment. Research on foodborne parasites should be improved to standardize experimental approaches for evaluation of inactivation techniques and methods to monitor inactivation.},

	abstract = {Microbiological (M), chemical (C), and nutritional (N) risks associated with food products are usually assessed and managed independently by experts in public services or food companies. This can render difficult the comparison of food products in term of overall risk for the consumer. The objective of this study was to suggest a relatively simple method to (i) classify food products based on their M, C and N risks, and (ii) aggregate these risks and rank the food products accordingly. The method was developed and applied to 17 ready-to-eat (RTE) dishes available on the French market. With regard to food safety, the individual M and C risks were characterized considering likelihood and severity as recommended by the Codex Alimentarius. With regard to nutrition/health, the N risk was estimated based on the tendency of the dish to contribute to nutrient adequacy and to a healthy eating pattern. Finally, the outranking method PROMETHEE was applied to aggregate the three M, C, N risks and rank the food dishes. Food products were ranked relatively to each other, not in absolute terms. When we attributed the same weight to M, C and N risks, the RTE dish “Duck Parmentier” had the highest risk score while “Papillote of chicken, potatoes and small vegetables” and “Vegetarian plate vegetables and quinoa” had the lowest. However, this overall ranking changed according to the weight assigned to individual M, C and N risks, at least for food products whose scores varied according to risk types, such as”sushi discovery” (high M and C risks, low N risk). Since the risk ranking method developed here was built with assumptions and hypotheses related to the specific case study, more applications are needed to assess whether it can be generic. Nevertheless, this method is well grounded, objective, transparent, relatively fast and easy to set up. It might lead to further development of decision tools, particularly for consumers. This study paves the way towards food product multi-risk ranking.},

Almost all commonly observed inactivation patterns, the log-linear is just a special case, can be described by both deterministic and fully stochastic models, examples of which are given. Unlike the deterministic, the stochastic models predict either complete elimination of the targeted cells or spores in realistic finite time, or residual survival. In most cases, the published survival data do not contain enough information to establish which actually happens. The microbial safety of thermally processed foods can be compromised not only by under-processing but also by a variety of mishaps whose occurrence probabilities are unrelated to the inactivation kinetics. Moreover, the available sampling plans to detect microbial contamination in sterilized containers through incubation alone are insensitive to levels of potential safety concerns. In principle, many of these issues could be resolved by developing new dramatically improved detection methods and/or verifiable methods to predict very low levels of microbial survival.},

	abstract = {The potential of stabilised Brie to support growth of the food-borne pathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica serotypes 0:3 and 0:9, Salmonella typhimurium, S. dublin (both dairy isolates), S. thompson, and Bacillus cereus (3 dairy isolates), after contamination on opening the cheese package was evaluated. Growth kinetics of the different pathogens was determined in relation to inoculum size and storage temperature (4°C, 8°C and 20°C). Only Y. enterocolitica was found to grow on the surfaces (outer and exposed) of Brie at all three storage temperatures. Growth of this pathogen during refrigerated storage must be avoided to ensure safety. The numbers of B. cereus and Salmonella increased at 20°C but declined at a slow rate during storage at 4°C and 8°C. However, survival of these two pathogens for extended periods at abuse temperatures could pose a health hazard. Predictions from a predictive modelling program (MFS model) and a modelling database (Food Micromodel) were compared to observed growth values in Brie. Although accurate in the case of B. cereus at 20°C, predicted generation times were in general found to be considerably shorter than the observed values, i.e., overall they were ‘fail safe’. Predicted lag times, however, were generally longer compared to observed values in the case of Y. enterocolitica and at low inocula for Salmonella, and would ‘fail dangerous’ if used for predictive purposes.},

	abstract = {Aims: To determine the survival and growth characteristics of Cronobacter species (Enterobacter sakazakii) in infant wheat-based formulas reconstituted with water, milk, grape juice or apple juice during storage. Methods and Results: Infant wheat-based formulas were reconstituted with water, ultra high temperature milk, pasteurized grape or apple juices. The reconstituted formulas were inoculated with Cronobacter sakazakii and Cronobacter muytjensii and stored at 4, 25 or 37°C for up to 24 h. At 25 and 37°C, Cronobacter grew more ({\textgreater}5 log10) in formulas reconstituted with water or milk than those prepared with grape or apple juices (c. 2–3 log10). The organism persisted, but did not grow in any formulas stored at 4°C. Formulas reconstituted with water and milk decreased from pH 6·0 to 4·8–5·0 after 24 h, whereas the pH of the formulas reconstituted with fruit juices remained at their initial pH values, c. pH 4·8–5·0. Conclusions: Cronobacter sakazakii and C. muytjensii can grow in reconstituted wheat-based formulas. If not immediately consumed, these formulas should be stored at refrigeration temperatures to reduce the risk of infant infection. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study will be of use to regulatory agencies and infant formula producers to recommend storage conditions that reduce the growth of Cronobacter in infant wheat-based formulas.},

	abstract = {Yersinia enterocolitica is a foodborne pathogen well known for its ability to grow at low temperatures. Recent studies with another psychrotrophic foodborne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, revealed that temperature of growth had pronounced impact on survival following repeated freezing and thawing (cryotolerance). Listerial cryotolerance was significantly more pronounced when bacteria were grown at 37 degrees C than following growth at either 4 degrees C or 25 degrees C. However, it is not known whether such impact of growth temperature is a general adaptation shared with other foodborne pathogens. In this study, we investigated the impact of growth temperature (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C) on cryotolerance of Y. enterocolitica. In strong contrast to findings previously obtained with Listeria spp., cryotolerance of Y. enterocolitica was impaired following growth in liquid media at 37 degrees C, with cell concentration dropping to undetectable levels ({\textless}10(1) colony forming unit/mL) following as few as six freeze-thaw cycles. On the other hand, when the bacteria were grown at 4 degrees C, cryotolerance was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05), and substantial survival was maintained even after 18 cycles (2-5 log reduction, depending on strain). Enhanced cryotolerance was also observed with cultures grown at 25 degrees C. Bacteria grown at 37 degrees C on agar were significantly more cryotolerant than following growth at 37 degrees C in liquid media (p {\textless} 0.05). The data suggest species-specific impact of growth temperature and liquid versus agar medium on cryotolerance of cold-tolerant bacteria.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the behavior (growth and/or survival) of Listeria monocytogenes on broccoli and cauliflower florets stored at different postharvest temperatures utilized along the supply chain. Broccoli and cauliflower samples were inoculated with L. monocytogenes at approximately 3 log CFU/g and stored at 23 ± 2, 12 ± 2, 4 ± 2, and -18 ± 2°C. Samples were evaluated for L. monocytogenes levels after 0, 0.167 (4 h), 1, 2, 3, and 4 days at 23 ± 2°C; 0, 0.167, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days at 12 ± 2°C; 0, 0.167, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days at 4 ± 2°C; and 0, 1, 7, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, and 168 days at -18 ± 2°C. L. monocytogenes populations were determined by plating samples onto tryptic soy agar and modified Oxford agar supplemented with nalidixic acid. Broccoli and cauliflower supported the growth of L. monocytogenes at 23, 12, and 4°C, and higher growth rates were observed at higher temperatures. Populations of L. monocytogenes on broccoli and cauliflower samples significantly increased within 1 day at 23°C (by 1.6 and 2.0 log CFU/g, respectively) (P ≤ 0.05). At 12°C, populations of L. monocytogenes on broccoli and cauliflower samples significantly increased over 14 days by 1.4 and 1.9 log CFU/g, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). No significant difference over time was observed in L. monocytogenes populations on broccoli and cauliflower samples held under refrigeration until populations began to grow by day 10 in both commodities (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Under frozen storage (-18°C), populations of L. monocytogenes survived on broccoli and cauliflower at least up to 168 days. Storage of broccoli and cauliflower at lower temperatures can minimize L. monocytogenes growth potential; growth rates were lower at 4°C than at 12 and 23°C.},

	abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes was linked to an outbreak of foodborne illness associated with in-process contaminated ice cream in the United States from 2010 to 2015 that sickened 10 individuals and led to 3 deaths. Ice cream obtained from the outbreak was used in this study to examine the population dynamics of L. monocytogenes as in-process contaminants compared with artificially inoculated cells. Because challenge studies of food products generally use artificial contamination, it is necessary to understand the differences in survival, if any, between these 2 types of contaminants. We hypothesized that laboratory-grown cultures of the pathogen that were not exposed to the environmental stresses of the manufacturing facility would show different population dynamics in an ice cream challenge study compared with in-process contaminants. In this study, half of the outbreak-associated ice cream samples were artificially inoculated with a 10 cfu/g cocktail of L. monocytogenes; the other half contained only the in-process contaminants. All samples were stored at −20°C and tested for pathogen levels (n = 10 for each contaminant type at each time point) by the most probable number method at 3-mo intervals for 36 mo. Generally, population levels between the 2 contamination states in the ice cream were not significantly different and L. monocytogenes survived for at least 36 mo, regardless of contamination state. Overall, our results suggest that the use of L. monocytogenes as an artificial contaminant in challenge studies and risk assessment of ice cream during frozen storage give results similar to those shown by in-process contaminants.},

Methods and Results The data from growth in Luria–Bertani broth (LB)-HCl (pH 4·0, 4·5, 4·8), LB-lactate (pH 4·5 and 4·8) and LB-NaCl (5\%, 7\%) were fitted to modified Gompertz equations to enable quantitative comparisons across strains and media conditions. Serogroup O45 strains had growth rates that were equal to or significantly greater than the O157:H7 control strain in all growth conditions tested. The growth rate was independent from the maximum growth achieved, but three strains (103A, 121A and 45B) had significantly faster growth and greater maximum cell densities in LB-NaCl 5\% (strain 103A), LB-HCl pH 4·0 (strain 121A) and LB-NaCl 7\% (strain 45B). Survival in LB-HCl pH 3·0 of four strains (103C, 111B, 26B and 26C) was significantly greater and five strains (26A, 45A, 111A, 121A and 145A) were significantly reduced in comparison with the O157:H7 control strain. None of the STEC strains had greater survival in LB-NaCl 12\% than the O157:H7 control strain. A significant association was found between the exponential phase, but not stationary phase, RpoS level and survival of STEC. Conclusions Some STEC strains had growth or survival properties that exceeded those of the O157:H7 control strain, but none of the non-O157 STEC had both significantly greater growth and survival properties. STEC survival was associated with the exponential-phase RpoS level. Significance and Impact of the Study Results from this study define the variability in growth and survival of STEC strains that will be useful defining food product formulations and process interventions to control STEC. The presence of exponential phase σs expands the significance of this alternative sigma factor.},

After stress treatments, bacterial populations, expression of virulence-associated genes, and Vero-cytotoxicity were determined. Among the strains, O145:NM survived at aw 0.97 longer than other serotypes, while O111:NM was significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress. At pH 4, O103:H1 was more resistant to the stress, while O26:H11 and O111:NM had significantly less growth. For 2 ppm chlorine stress, O26:H11, O103:H1, and O145:NM had higher populations (\&gt;3 log) than other strains. Stressed strains showed a significant increase in relative gene expression levels of stx1, stx2, and eae in O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM than non-stressed control. Additionally, significantly higher Vero-cytotoxicity, as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase assay, of stressed O26:H11, O103:H1, O104:H4, and O145:NM was observed.

	abstract = {A methodology based on the combination of two complementary approaches to rank microbiological risks in foods is presented. In the forward approach data on the pathogenicity of hazards and their behaviour in food during processing and following steps, up to consumption, are used in decision trees to qualitatively estimate the risk associated with foods. In the backward approach risks are evaluated based on the analysis of data available on the past occurrence of hazards and foodborne outbreaks. The categorisation of foods using the forward approach should prevail, and whenever it leads to a likely risk for a given food, the risk can be further qualified with the results from the backward approach. The methodology developed was applied to rank the public health risk posed by certain composite products, which contain both processed products of animal origin and products of plant origin (e.g., bread, cakes, chocolate). Despite limitations in the data available for these foods, valuable results were obtained. The method is therefore considered suitable for application with success to other types of food, and is proposed as a tool for risk managers to rank foods based on their potential food safety risks.},

	abstract = {Parasites are important food-borne pathogens. Their complex lifecycles, varied transmission routes, and prolonged periods between infection and symptoms mean that the public health burden and relative importance of different transmission routes are often difficult to assess. Furthermore, there are challenges in detection and diagnostics, and variations in reporting. A Europe-focused ranking exercise, using multicriteria decision analysis, identified potentially food-borne parasites of importance, and that are currently not routinely controlled in food. These are Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Echinococcus spp. Infection with these parasites in humans and animals, or their occurrence in food, is not notifiable in all Member States. This Opinion reviews current methods for detection, identification and tracing of these parasites in relevant foods, reviews literature on food-borne pathways, examines information on their occurrence and persistence in foods, and investigates possible control measures along the food chain. The differences between these three parasites are substantial, but for all there is a paucity of well-established, standardised, validated methods that can be applied across the range of relevant foods. Furthermore, the prolonged period between infection and clinical symptoms (from several days for Cryptosporidium to years for Echinococcus spp.) means that source attribution studies are very difficult. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the domestic animal lifecycle (involving dogs and livestock) for Echinoccocus granulosus means that this parasite is controllable. For Echinococcus multilocularis, for which the lifecycle involves wildlife (foxes and rodents), control would be expensive and complicated, but could be achieved in targeted areas with sufficient commitment and resources. Quantitative risk assessments have been described for Toxoplasma in meat. However, for T. gondii and Cryptosporidium as faecal contaminants, development of validated detection methods, including survival/infectivity assays and consensus molecular typing protocols, are required for the development of quantitative risk assessments and efficient control measures.},

Because the production and monetary losses associated with them are often not visible, and the infected animals often show no signs, they are very difficult to detect. Different types of parasitic diseases can be transmitted to humans from pork, fish, freshwater crustaceans, vegetables, eggs of tapeworms, and protozoa. The risks associated with all of them can, however, be avoided through the application of good hygiene, good farming and fishing practices, and the promotion of community awareness. For example, the promotion of a participatory approach and the development of training packages for food business operators would be beneficial in raising awareness within the community. Basic information regarding how the parasites are transmitted and their effects, and any and all preventive measures that each person can take, should be included in communication topics. Food safety authorities can play an important part by using the guidance provided by Codex Alimentarius regarding animal production, food processing, and meat inspection. Furthermore, the development of networks of authorities committed to addressing the problem would help prevent and control the spread of parasitic diseases.},

Inactivation of HAV and inactivation of feline calicivirus, a surrogate for HuNoV, were assessed by viral culturing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), whereas HuNoV survival was determined only by quantitative RT-PCR. While freeze-drying barely reduced ({\textless}1.3 log10 units) the amount of HAV RNA detected in frozen produce, a greater decline in HAV infectivity was observed. The resistance of HuNoV genogroup I (GI) to freeze-drying was significantly higher than that of HuNoV GII on berries. Addition of a terminal dry heat treatment at 120°C after freeze-drying enhanced virus inactivation by at least 2 log10 units, except for HuNoV GII. The results suggest that steam blanching at 95°C for 2.5 min effectively inactivated infectious enteric viruses if they were present in herbs. Our results provide data for adjusting food processing technologies if viral contamination of raw materials is suspected.},

	abstract = {Foodborne enteric viruses, in particular HuNoV and HAV, are the most common cause of the berry-linked viral diseases, and outbreaks around the world, and have become an important concern for health authorities. Despite the increased importance of berry fruits as a vehicle for foodborne viruses, there is limited information concerning the fate of foodborne viruses in the berry supply chain from farm to consumer. A comprehensive understanding of berry-associated viral outbreaks – with a focus on contamination sources, persistence, survival, and the effects of current postharvest and processing interventions and practices – is essential for the development of effective preventative strategies to reduce risk of illness. The purpose of this paper is twofold; (i) to critically review the published literature on the current state of knowledge regarding berry-associated foodborne viral outbreaks and the efficiency of berry processing practices and (ii) to identify and prioritize research gaps regarding practical and effective mechanism to reduce viral contamination of berries. The review found that fecally infected food handlers were the predominant source of preharvest and postharvest pathogenic viral contamination. Current industrial practices applied to fresh and frozen berries demonstrated limited efficacy for reducing the viral load. While maintaining best practice personal and environmental hygiene is a key intervention, the optimization of processing parameters (i.e., freezing, frozen storage, and washing) and/or development of alternative processing technologies to induce sufficient viral inactivation in berries along with retaining sensory and nutritional quality, is also an important direction for further research.},

	abstract = {Human noroviruses (HNoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are predominantly linked to foodborne outbreaks worldwide. As cell-culture systems to propagate HNoV in laboratories are not easily available, Tulane virus (TV) is used as a cultivable HNoV surrogate to determine inactivation. Heat-sensitization of HAV and TV by “generally recognized as safe’’ (GRAS) substances can potentially reduce their time-temperature inactivation parameters during processing to ensure food safety. Curcumin, gingerol (from ginger), and grape seed extract (GSE) reportedly have anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating and antiviral properties. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the D-values and z-values of HAV and TV at 52–68 °C with or without curcumin (0.015 mg/ml), gingerol (0.1 mg/ml), or GSE (1 mg/ml) in 2-ml glass vials. HAV at {\textasciitilde}7 log PFU/ml and TV at {\textasciitilde}6 log PFU/ml were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and added to two sets of six 2-mL sterile glass vials. One set served as the control and the second set had the three extracts individually added for thermal treatments in a circulating water bath for 0–10 min. The D-values for TV in PBS ranged from 4.55 ± 0.28 to 1.08 ± 0.16 min, and for HAV in PBS ranged from to 9.21 ± 0.24 to 0.67 ± 0.19 min at 52–68 °C. Decreased D-values (52–58 °C) for TV with curcumin ranging from 4.32 ± 0.25 to 0.62 ± 0.17 min, gingerol from 4.09 ± 0.18 to 0.72 ± 0.09 min and GSE from 3.82 ± 0.18 to 0.80 ± 0.07 min, with similar trends for HAV were observed. The linear model showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between the D-values of HAV and TV with and without plant extracts for most tested temperatures. This suggests that GRAS substances can potentially lower temperature and time regimens needed to inactivate HAV and TV.},

	abstract = {Foodborne illness outbreaks have been increasingly linked to the consumption of fresh and frozen berries that were contaminated with pathogenic viruses, such as human norovirus (NoV). Contamination of berries is assumed to take place at harvest by the use of contaminated water for pesticide dilution, irrigation water source or by shedding berry pickers in the field. A quantitative microbial risk assessment simulation model was built to replicate the largest known NoV outbreak which sickened about 11,000 people over a 3-week period. The outbreak occurred in Germany in 2012 when contaminated frozen strawberries were served at nearly 400 schools and daycare centers. The risk model explicitly assumed that all contamination would arise from NoV contamination of surface water used for pesticide dilution. Input data was collected from the published literature, observational studies and assumptions. The model starts with contamination of the berries in the field, and proceeds through transportation to processing facility, washing, sanitizing, freezing, frozen transport to cargo ship, transport view of cargo ship, transport to distribution center, frozen storage at the distribution center, transport to the catering facility, food service preparation and consumption, dose response, and predicted illnesses. A total of 21 scenarios were chosen to evaluate the impact of model parameters on the number of illness associated with NoV contamination of berries. Scenarios evaluated include the initial level of NoV in surface water, the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of NoV in surface water, the strength of the pesticide used, the volume of water used to dilute the pesticide, temperature during transportation to processing facility, washing and sanitizing conditions at processing facility and preparation (heat-treatment) of berries prior to consumption. Scenarios were compared via the Factor Sensitivity technique where the logarithm of the ratio of mean illnesses was used to compare different assumptions. The input that had the greatest effect on increasing in the number of illnesses was a high NoV concentration in the water (8 log Genome Copies/L) when compared to the baseline scenario with resulting mean illnesses of 7964 illnesses and ∼2 illnesses, respectively. This assumption about the concentration of virus in the pesticide makeup water was the only variable capable of producing an outbreak similar to that observed in Germany in 2012. Heat-treatment of the berries, use of a pesticide with strong antiviral effect, and assumption about the virus concentration in the pesticide make-up water had the largest impact on decreasing illnesses.},

	abstract = {Water is an essential component of food structures and biological materials. The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions’ stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies.},

There have been several historical foodborne illness breakouts involving L. monocytogenes. In 1981, L. monocytogenes was revealed to be a foodborne illness linked to a variety of foods.  In 1985, a massive outbreak of L. monocytogenes was traced to a brand of soft cheeses involving 142 cases, 28 deaths, and 20 fetal losses. While L. monocytogenes is not the most common foodborne illness, it has the highest mortality rate secondary to its unique virulence factors. L. monocytogenes’ virulence factors include but are not limited to intracellular mobility via actin polymerization and the ability to replicate at refrigerator temperatures. This makes it difficult for food industries to control. Transmission of the bacteria occurs via the fecal-oral route and most commonly involves foods such as cold deli meats and unpasteurized dairy products. The number of cases involving L. monocytogenes has decreased in recent years thanks to advances in prevention, detection, and treatment. Infection via L. monocytogenes (listeriosis) includes but is not limited to sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, or fever and self-limiting gastroenteritis in a healthy adult.

One third of parasitic outbreaks with known source in the US are attributable to food of animal origin (FoAO). Among 24 foodborne parasites ranked by FAO/WHO, 14 are associated with FoAO. Management of these biological hazards is essential for food safety.
Scope and approach
Control measures to inactivate the 12 most relevant parasites in FoAO are evaluated, including cooking, freezing, curing, and traditionally applied food-processing techniques, as well as high-pressure treatment and irradiation.
Key findings and conclusions
How inactivation is determined may affect results, however efficacy of freezing and heating depends on parasite species and developmental stage, as well as temperature and time conditions. Cooking at core temperature 60–75 °C for 15–30 min inactivates parasites in most matrices. Freezing at −21 °C for 1–7 days generally inactivates parasites in FoAO, but cannot be relied upon in home situations. Parasitic stages are sensitive to 2–5\% NaCl, often augmented by lowering pH. Gamma irradiation at {\textgreater}0.1–0.5 kGy is effective for fish parasites, except Anisakis (10 kGy); {\textgreater}0.4–6.5 kGy control meatborne parasites. More research is needed to investigate and improve irradiation technologies using sustainable energy sources. Literature data are diverse and insufficient to model survival as response to treatment. Research on foodborne parasites should be improved to standardize experimental approaches for evaluation of inactivation techniques and methods to monitor inactivation.},

In the present work, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed, and a quadratic equation of high hydrostatic pressure inactivation was built with RSM. By analyzing response surface plots and corresponding contour plots and by solving the quadratic equation, experimental values were shown to be significantly in agreement with predicted values, since the adjusted determination coefficient (RAdj2) was 0.9752 and the level of significance was P {\textless} 0.0001. Optimum process parameters for a six-log cycle reduction of B. cereus spores were obtained: pressure, 540.0 MPa; temperature, 71 °C; and pressure-holding time, 16.8 min. The adequacy of the model equation in predicting optimum response values was verified effectively using experimental test data that was not used in the development of the model. © 2007 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.},

UHPH-treated soymilk was compared with the base product (untreated), with pasteurized (95°C for 30. s) and with ultra high temperature (UHT; 142°C for 6. s) treated soymilks. Microbiological (total aerobic meshophilic bacteria, aerobic spores, and Bacillus cereus), physical (dispersion stability and particle size distribution) and chemical (lipoxygenase activity, hydroperoxide index and trypsin inhibitor activity) parameters of special relevance in soymilk were studied. Microbiological results showed that pressure and inlet temperature combination had a significant impact on the lethal effect of UHPH treatment. While most of UHPH treatments applied produced high quality of soymilks better than that pasteurized, the combination of 300. MPa and 75°C produced a commercially sterile soymilk. UHPH treatments caused a significant decrease in particle size resulting in a high physical stability of samples compared with conventional heat treatments.

The main objective of this work was to model the inactivation of psychrotrophic B. cereus spores in reconstituted milk treated by high pressure (HPP) combined with a thermal process, and to compare it with thermal inactivation kinetics. First, the effect of HPP pressure (200, 400 and 600 MPa) for up to 40 min at 70 °C on B. cereus spores was investigated. A pressure increment from 200 to 600 MPa slightly reduced the spore numbers in the reconstituted milk. Then the influence of temperature at 600 MPa on spore inactivation for up to 40 min was studied. Increasing the HPP temperature from 38 to 70 °C increased the spore inactivation in milk by 3.5 log. The 600 MPa combined with heat enhanced the spore inactivation in milk, requiring a temperature 20 °C lower to achieve the same spore inactivation. However, for a 5 log spore inactivation, the pressure-thermal process required a higher specific energy than the thermal processing. The resistance of two psychrotrophic strains of B. cereus spores in milk was also investigated and showed similar results. The Weibull model described spore inactivation by pressure-heat, whereas the first order kinetics was more appropriate for the thermal inactivation alone. The results of this study confirmed the advantage of HPP technology to further increase the thermal inactivation of B. cereus spores in milk. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Variation in pressure resistance between two strains of each organism were studied. The effect of growth stage (exponential and stationary phase), growth temperature (8 and 30°C) on pressure resistance, and sublethal pressure injury were investigated. Exponential-phase cells were significantly less resistant to pressure than stationary-phase cells for all of the three species studied (P {\textless} 0.05). Growth temperature was found to have a significant effect at the two growth stages studied. Exponential cells grown at 8°C were more resistant than those grown at 30°C, but for stationary-phase cells the reverse was true. B. cereus stationary-phase cells grown at 30°C were the most pressure resistant studied. L. monocytogenes showed the most sublethal damage compared to B. cereus and P. fluorescens. B. cereus spores were more resistant to pressure than vegetative cells. Pressure treatment at 400 MPa for 25 min at 30°C gave a 0.45-1og inactivation. Pressure treatment at 8°C induced significantly less spore germination than at 30°C. This study indicates the importance of the history of a bacterial culture prior to pressure treatment and that bacterial spores require more severe pressure treatments, probably in combination with other preservation techniques, to ensure inactivation.},

However, spores can be resistant to pressures as high as 1000 MPa, which in the absence of heat limits the application of HPP to pasteurization only. A new technology has been recently developed to generate mild pressure by heating the treated liquid food in enclosure. This technology was examined for its ability to inactivate spore forming bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus) to produce a sterile product which retained its original organoleptic characteristics. Results shows that this pressure assisted thermal sterilization process could decrease the decimal reduction time (D-value) and hence, reduce the sterilization temperature significantly. The mild pressure generated assisted spores to germinate allowing the heat to inactivate the germinated spores. Vegetative microorganisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli) were also tested using the technology. However, the effect of this mild pressure on the inactivation was found insignificant. © 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

B. cereus sporulated at the lowest temperature was found to be the most resistant to the initiation of germination and inactivation by HHP. At ambient pressure, the rate and extension of germination induced by l-alanine were also lower in B. cereus sporulated at 20 than 30 or 37°C. The optimum pH for the germination and inactivation of B. cereus depended on the sporulation temperature. At 250 mPa the extent of germination for the three suspensions increased with higher pH. At 690 mPa, the pH barely affected the germination of B. cereus sporulated at 20°C (3 log cycles), but the inactivation increased as the pH of the medium was lowered. After the same treatment, pressure optimally initiated the germination of B. cereus sporulated at 30 and 37°C (6-7 log cycles) around neutral pH. Higher inactivation was obtained at pH 6. High concentrations of sucrose protected the spores from the germinating and inactivating effect of HHP. At a(w) 0.92, no germination was detected when the spores were pressurized at 250 mPa, and only 1 log cycle of B. cereus sporulated at 20 and 30°C and 2 log cycles of B. cereus sporulated at 37°C were germinated at 690 mPa. In addition, no inactivation was observed at a(w) 0.92 even at 690 mPa. The presence of l-alanine in the medium of pressurization increased the germination initiated by HHP at 250 mPa, but not at 690 mPa. A combination of 250 mPa at 25°C with l-alanine (100 mM) was found to give an additive response. The initiation of germination and inactivation by HHP were not affected by the fat concentration of the milk. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

High pressure processing (HPP) and power ultrasound are two technologies that can be combined with heat (HPP-thermal or HPTP, TS) to increase the rate of spore inactivation. The objective of this study was to compare HPP, HPTP and TS with exclusively thermal processing to inactivate spores of two pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus) as well as fruit spoilage microorganisms (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris bacteria, Byssochlamys nivea and Neosartorya fischeri moulds, and Saccharomyces cerevisisae yeast). For a 20 min process at 75 °C, 600 MPa HPTP was the best technology for the inactivation of spores of C. perfringens in beef slurry (2.2 vs. 0.9 log for 0.33 W/g TS and no inactivation for thermal treatment). Likewise, at 70 °C 600 MPa HPTP was better to inactivate B. cereus spores in milk than single thermal treatment (4.0 vs. 0.3 log after 20 min process). At 75 °C 600 MPa HPTP was also the best technology for the inactivation of mould ascospores of N. fischeri in apple juice (4.3 log) and B. nivea in strawberry puree (2.0 log) vs. no effect for thermal and even increase in the spores with TS after a 20 min process. TS was a better technology than thermal treatment to reduce A. acidoterrestris spores in orange juice (0.6 vs. 0.2 log after 20 min at 78 °C). Regarding S. cerevisiae ascospores inactivation in beer, non-thermal HPP was much better than TS and thermal processing: 3 log reductions required only 30 s at 400 MPa vs. 5 min for 16.2 W/mL-TS-55 °C and 84 min for 55 °C thermal. Overall, the heat assisted HPP technology was better than TS and thermal treatment alone for the inactivation of bacteria, mould, and yeast spores, requiring lower processing times thus allowing a better food quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In an introductory experiment with strain LMG6910 treated at 40°C for 30 min at 0, 100, 300 and 600 MPa, germination levels were 1.5 to 3 logs higher in milk than in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7). The effects of pressure and germination-inducing components present in the milk on spore germination were synergistic. More detailed experiments were conducted in milk at a range of pressures between 100 and 600 MPa at temperatures between 30 and 60°C to identify treatments that allow a 6 log inactivation of B. cereus spores. The mildest treatment resulting in a 6 log germination was 30 min at 200 MPa/40°C. Lower treatment pressures or temperatures resulted in considerably less germination, and higher pressures and temperatures further increased germination, but a small fraction of spores always remained ungerminated. Further, not all germinated spores were inactivated by the pressure treatment, even under the most severe conditions (600 MPa/60°C). Two possible approaches to achieve a 6 log spore inactivation were identified, and validated in three additional B. cereus strains. The first is a single step treatment at 500 MPa/60°C for 30 min, the second is a two-step treatment consisting of pressure treatment for 30 min at 200 MPa/45°C to induce spore germination, followed by mild heat treatment at 60°C for 10 min to kill the germinated spores. Reduction of the pressurization time to 15 min still allows a 5 log inactivation.

	abstract = {Food processing treatments can alter the microbial biodiversity which can significantly affect shelf-life and safety. These changes in biodiversity can be analysed using culture-independent community profiling methods to provide a better understanding of which bacteria are resistant to the process. In this study, we used rice as a model food that contains a rich bacterial biodiversity to determine what effect variable high pressure processing (HPP) parameters and/or cooking has on the bacterial population. Two samples of milled rice each from two harvest years were pressured at 0, 200, 400 or 600 MPa for 10 min at 25 °C, then either cooked at 100 °C or left uncooked. Samples were stored at 25 °C for up to 8 weeks or until spoilage was detected by total aerobic plate count. Bacterial DNA was extracted and the community composition was analysed by Illumina sequencing of 250 bp of 16S rDNA. Pressured, uncooked samples spoiled after one day of storage at 25 °C and it was found that pressures at and above 400 MPa selected for aerobic sporeformers namely Bacillaceae being the dominant group. Of these, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis or Paenibacillus amylolyticus groups were the most abundant in samples. The untreated rehydrated rice control and rice treated at 200 MPa contained spoilage populations consisting of a mix of primarily Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae suggesting that 200 MPa treatment was not severe enough to eliminate Gram-negative bacteria. Cooked rice samples spoiled after three days storage at 25 °C and contained almost exclusively Bacillus spp. with B. subtilis and B. cereus groups dominating the populations. With pressures of 400 and 600 MPa, cooked samples remained unspoilt after eight weeks of storage at 25 °C with sequences representing DNA from a highly heterogeneous mix of non-viable bacterial cells. The lower pressure treatment (200 MPa) combined with cooking resulted in one out of four samples spoiling due to growth of Bacillus flexus group bacteria. In summary, the culture-independent method used here demonstrates that higher HPP (400 and 600 MPa) treatment or cooking alone selected for sporeforming bacterial spoilage profiles. A combination of HPP (400 and 600 MPa) with cooking resulted in ambient temperature stable rice, with no growth of potentially hazardous sporeformers observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The project started with an industry survey of commercial cleaning and sanitation agents used in the Nordic countries. Based on this survey a list of different types of priorized cleaning agents and disinfectants were included. The variation in testing procedures and scientific data acheived for these agents raised the motivation to prepare a harmonized testing procedure for agents used in the dairy industry. Parameters used in foam cleaning in open systems and cleaning-in-place (= CIP) procedures in closed systems were chosen to design the sanitation experiments in pilot scale. Disinfectant testing both in suspensions and on surfaces were included in the experiments. Traditional cultivation was selected as a routine method. The cultivation method assessed the viable bacteria, which were able to form colonies on agar. The staining procedure was developed and the swabbing technique using novel swabbing detergents was evaluated in pilot and process scale. The cultivation results in comparison to microscopy showed that sampling from a surface was improved when the swabs were moistened with a detergent solution containing surfactants or enzymes and abrasives. The image analysis of preparations stained with acridine orange assessed biofilm and soil left on the surface. The microscopical technique using DNA stains and metabolic indicators enabled the distinction of dead and viable cells left on the surfaces. Furthermore, methods such as impedance, contact agar, agar moulding and ATP were used in the assessments. The testing of six disinfectants selected by the dairy partners, Valio Ltd. and Norwegian Dairies, were performed using tests proposed by CEN (prEN 1040 and prEN 1276). The microbes used were standard test organisms as well as spoilage bacteria, pathogens and spores of concern in dairies. The prEN 1040 did not differentiate between the six disinfectants, whereas high levels of interfering substances e.g. skimmed milk and hard water used in prEN 1276 reduced the efficiency of the majority of the disinfectants to variable degrees. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most resistant to all disinfectants tested. Salmonella infantis was the most difficult to kill of the four "industrial" strains. Spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis were reduced by less than 1 log unit in the suspension test. The testing of disinfectants using 80\% of the lowest recommended concentrations of the agents differentiated well between their efficiency at the described test conditions given in prEN 1276. These results. showed that the alcohol-based IPA 300 was the most efficient of the agents tested. More stringent tests are, however, clearly needed to simulate the conditions of practical application. Results in surface tests showed that Pseudomonas fragi cells dried on surfaces was more resistant to the disinfectants than were cells in suspension. The results obtained in the experiments on cleaning of closed systems showed that treatment with alkaline cleaning agents containing chelating agent in combination with potassium hydroxide was more efficient in removing soil and biofilm than the alkaline agent containing only sodium hydroxide. The suitability of a cleaning agent was dependent on the consistency of the soil and the type of bacteria to be removed from the surface and the surface material. The results of the microscopic and impedance assessments after the surfaces were swabbed showed that some biofilm remained on the surface after all the cleaning procedures were performed. The results from the tests using low pressure cleaning of open systems showed that treatment with a strong alkaline cleaning agent containing hypochlorite was more efficient in removing biofilm than a milder alkaline agent designed for non-processing surfaces. The level of the bacteria on unsoiled surfaces was lower than on presoiled surfaces. The results, however, indicated that the low pressure application system was not effective in removing all the biofilm unless the foaming agent itself was very effective. Therefore, the foaming agent must remain in contact with the surface for a sufficient length of time without drying. The efficiency of the foaming agent was dependent on its ability both to remove biofouled layers from the working surface and to kill the bacteria in the biofilm. The aim of fogging or disinfection testing in industrial scale was to study the efficiency of the disinfection on the exposed surfaces at different places in the room. Fogging may be defined as "chemical disinfection by means of automatic spraying of the disinfectant into a closed room". Controlled experiments with fogging were carried out at two cheese producing dairies. Neither of the fogging trials showed clear reduction of the microbial load. The experiments at both dairies clearly demonstrated the need for thorough control and follow up of fogging. Critical points were the quality and amount of the fog, the disinfectant concentration and the rinsing. Insufficient rinsing only diluted the disinfectant and the disinfectant was not removed totally. The use of fogging also increased the humidity in the room, which may increase corrosion and damage on electrical equipment. Conclusion of the fogging experiment was that the effect was questionable, especially in critical points and also in dry rooms.},

	abstract = {Bacillus cereus spores are a concern to the food industry due to their high resistance to processing and their ability to germinate to vegetative cells under suitable conditions. This research aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of Bacillus cereus spore inactivation under ultrasonication (US) combined with thermal (thermosonication, TS) treatments, with pressure (manosonication, MS) treatments, and with thermal and pressure (manothermosonication, MTS) treatments. Electronic microscopy, dipicolinic acid (DPA) release, and flow cytometric assessments were used to investigate the inactivation effect and understand the inactivation mechanisms. The sporicidal effects of the US and thermal treatment were slight, and the MS and TS also showed little inactivation effect. However, ultrasonication promoted the detachment of the exosporium, thereby reducing the spore’s ability to adhere to a surface, while the thermal treatment induced a decrease in the electron density in the nucleoid of bacterium, which retained a relatively intact exosporium and coat. MS caused 92.54\% DPA release, which might be due to triggering of the germinant receptors or releasing of ions and Ca                             2+                             -DPA. In addition, the morphological changes such as core hydration and cortex degradation were significant after treatment with MS. The release of DPA and the morphological changes were responsible for the reduction in thermal resistance. The MTS showed a remarkable inactivation effect of 3.12 log CFU/mL reductions after 30 min of treatment. It was the most effective treatment and exhibited a large fraction of damage. In addition, the MTS had a significant impact on the intracellular structure of the spores, with the coat destroyed and the cortex damaged. These results indicated that ultrasonication combined with thermal and pressure treatments had a significant sporicidal effect on Bacillus cereus spores and could be a promising green sterilization technology.                          © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Endospore resistance of seven Clostridium botulinum strains was compared with those of Bacillus spp. (B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. smithii, B. amyloliquefaciens) and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum with respect to pressure (600 to 800 MPa) and temperature (80 to 116°C) treatments in mashed carrots. A large variation was observed in the pressure resistance of C. botulinum spores. Their reduction after treatments with 600 MPa at 80°C for 1 s ranged from more than 5.5 log units to no reduction. Spores of the proteolytic C. botulinum TMW 2.357 exhibited a greater resistance to pressure than spores from all other bacteria examined, with the exception of B. amyloliquefaciens. Heat resistance of spores did not correlate with pressure resistance, either within strains of C. botulinum or when C. botulinum spores were compared with spores of T. thermosaccharolyticum. A quantitative release of dipicolinic acid was observed from C. botulinum spores on combined pressure and temperature treatments only after inactivation of more than 99.999\% of the spores. Thus, dipicolinic acid is released by a physicochemical rather than a physiological process. The resistance of spores to combined pressure and temperature treatments correlated with their ability to retain dipicolinic acid. B. amyloliquefaciens, a mesophilic organism that forms highly pressure-resistant spores is proposed as a nonpathogenic target organism for high-pressure process development.},

Furthermore, under these processing conditions, commercial sterility (evaluated as the complete inactivation of the inoculated spores) was obtained in milk, with the exception of G.stearothermophilus and B.subtilis treated at 300MPa with Ti=75°C. The results showed that G.stearothermophilus and B.subtilis have higher resistance to the Ultra High-Pressure Homogenization treatments applied than the other microorganisms inoculated and that a treatment performed at 300MPa with Ti=85°C was necessary to completely inactivate these microorganisms at the spore level inoculated ({\textasciitilde}1×106CFU/mL). Besides, a change in the resistance of B.licheniformis, B.sporothermodurans, G.stearothermophilus and B.subtilis spores was observed as the inactivation obtained increased remarkably in treatments performed with Ti between 65 and 75°C.

Oyster meats were blended, autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min, inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus, and pressure treated at 250 MPa for 2 and 3 min and at 300 MPa for 1 and 2 min at 21°C. Overall, growth temperatures of 20 and 40°C yielded the greatest pressure resistance in V. parahaemolyticus. The effects of salt concentration and H2O2-degrading compounds on the recovery of V. parahaemolyticus also were investigated. Sterile oyster meats were inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus and treated at 250 MPa for 1, 2, or 3 min at 21°C. These meats were then blended with 0.1\% peptone water supplemented with 0.5 to 1.5\% NaCl and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with 0 to 3.5\% NaCl. For recovery of pressure-injured cells, peptone water with 1\% NaCl and TSA with 0.5\% NaCl were the best diluent and plating medium, respectively. Addition of sodium pyruvate (0.05 to 0.2\%) or catalase (8 to 32 U/ml) did not increase the recovery of V. parahaemolyticus after pressure treatment. The effect of incubation temperature and gas atmosphere on the recovery of V. parahaemolyticus after pressure treatment also was determined. Aerobic incubation at 30°C resulted in the highest recovery of V. parahaemolyticus in sterile oyster meats. The 30°C incubation temperature was also the optimum temperature for recovery of V. parahaemolyticus in pressure-treated live oysters. The results of this study indicate that the growth conditions for V. parahaemolyticus before and after high hydrostatic pressure treatment should be taken into consideration when assessing the efficacy of pressure inactivation.},

The objective was to explore high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) as an alternative to the traditional depuration process. The effect of HHP on the survival of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in live clams (Mercanaria mercanaria) and the impact of HHP on physical characteristics of clam meat were investigated. Clams were inoculated with up to 7 log CFU/g of a cocktail of V. parahaemolyticus strains via filter feeding. Clams were processed at pressures ranging from 250 to 552 MPa for hold times ranging between 2 and 6 min. Processing conditions of 450 MPa for 4 min and 350 MPa for 6 min reduced the initial concentration of V. parahaemolyticus to a nondetectable level ({\textless}101 CFU/g), achieving {\textgreater}5 log reductions. The volume of clam meat (processed in shell) increased with negligible change in mass after exposure to pressure at 552 MPa for 3 min, while the drip loss was reduced. Clams processed at 552 MPa were softer compared to those processed at 276 MPa. However, all HHP processed clams were found to be harder compared to unprocessed. The lightness (L*) of the meat increased although the redness (a*) decreased with increasing pressure. Although high pressure-processed clams may pose a significantly lower risk from V. parahaemolyticus, the effect of the accompanied physical changes on the consumer's decision to purchase HHP clams remains to be determined.

	abstract = {The current study aimed to develop an inactivation strategy for Clostridium perfringens spores in meat through a combination of spore activation at low pressure (100–200MPa, 7min) and elevated temperature (80°C, 10min); spore germination at high temperatures (55, 60 or 65°C); and inactivation of germinated spores with elevated temperatures (80 and 90°C, 10 and 20min) and high pressure (586MPa, at 23 and 73°C, 10min). Low pressures (100–200MPa) were insufficient to efficiently activate C. perfringens spores for germination. However, C. perfringens spores were efficiently activated with elevated temperature (80°C, 10min), and germinated at temperatures lethal for vegetative cells (≥55°C) when incubated for 60min with a mixture of l-asparagine and KCl (AK) in phosphate buffer (pH 7) and in poultry meat. Inactivation of spores (∼4 decimal reduction) in meat by elevated temperatures (80–90°C for 20min) required a long germination period (55°C for 60min). However, similar inactivation level was reached with shorter germination period (55°C for 15min) when spore contaminated-meat was treated with pressure-assisted thermal processing (568MPa, 73°C, 10min). Therefore, the most efficient strategy to inactivate C. perfringens spores in poultry meat containing 50mM AK consisted: (i) a primary heat treatment (80°C, 10min) to pasteurize and denature the meat proteins and to activate C. perfringens spores for germination; (ii) cooling of the product to 55°C in about 20min and further incubation at 55°C for about 15min for spore germination; and (iii) inactivation of germinated spores by pressure-assisted thermal processing (586MPa at 73°C for 10min). Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative and novel strategy to inactivate C. perfringens spores in meat products formulated with germinants specific for C. perfringens.},

Samples were processed with different variants of pressure (300,400,500) and time (1 min, 5 min, and 10 min). The number of bacteria in the populations was analyzed using plating count methods. Required 5 log reduction was achieved only for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}L. innocua{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} strains starting from 400 MPa for 5 min. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}E. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} strains displayed resistance to pressure, and the maximum reduction achieved was 2 log CFU/mL for the harshest process parameters. Sublethal injuries in the bacterial population were observed for all tested strains. According to two standardized ISO methods, selective conventional agars, TBX, and ALOA were used in the storage test. Additionally, the Thin Agar Layer (TAL) method was applied. In both used methods, the possibilities of recovery were provided. The regeneration was observed exclusively for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}L. innocua{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} strains. The recovery of sublethally injured cells on ALOA and TAL did not differ statistically in every strain. In turn, results obtained for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}E. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} suggest that TBX may underestimate the number of HHP-injured bacteria.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

	abstract = {The success of high-pressure processing (HPP) implementation by a large number of food companies demonstrates HPP is an effective safety measure that can be applied to mitigate risk for a variety of foods and beverages and to extend shelf life of refrigerated products. The HPP commercialization has led to a high demand from food manufactures to apply HPP despite the lack of a full understanding of factors that affect the efficacy of the process or associated risks linked to specific food products. Indeed, there is no standard methodology for validating HPP or established surrogates to verify process performance. Yet, a scientifically sound validation process is a critical component in assessing the efficacy of HPP as a microbial-control measure. This chapter will focus on HPP validation used for nonthermal pasteurization that reduces pathogen levels and support the reduction of vegetative microbes to extend shelf life of foods and beverages. The fundamental principles of HPP along with essential practical considerations in terms of critical product and process parameters, packaging, microbial challenge studies, and other testing and scaling up issues are discussed in detail to assist HPP end users to accelerate process innovation.},

Ascorbic acid (16–45 mg/100g), total carotenoid (66–241 mg/L), and total phenolic (30–44 mg/L) contents did not significantly change after HPP compared to the corresponding untreated blends. The natural microbiota (i.e. aerobic mesophilic bacteria) was kept below 2-log CFU/mL for 28 d of storage. pH and total soluble solids remarkably changed for untreated blends in 10 d while HPP-treated blends were more stable during 28 d. Color attributes (L*, a*, b*) were retained after HPP and during storage. This study identified less intense high pressure processes for carrot-orange juice blends compared to commercially applied pressure levels (i.e. 600 MPa) to produce microbiologically stable blends with preserved quality attributes depending on pH and blend proportion.},

	abstract = {The object of this study was to examine nonthermal treatments to reduce foodborne pathogens in beef that is consumed raw. Foodborne illness pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) were inoculated in the raw beef eye round. Death rates of foodborne illness pathogens were evaluated by nonthermal decontamination methods: high pressure processing (HPP) at 500 MPa for 2, 5, and 7 min; UV light-emitting diode (LED) radiation at 405nm for 2, 6, and 24 h; hypochlorous acid water (HAW) at 100 ppm for 1, 3, and 5 min; 2.5\% lactic acid (LA) for 1, 3, and 5 min; modified atmosphere packaging that replaced O2 to CO2 for 24 and 48 h with anaerogen (O2 levels were less than 1\% and CO2 levels were 9 to 13\%); and bio-gel application (BGA) for 24 and 48 h. For the bio-gel preparation, 5\% sodium alginate was dissolved in 40 mL of glycerol and mixed with 0.2\% CaCl2 dissolved in 60 mL of water, and this mixture was left at room temperature for solidification. Quality characteristics (color, pH, water activity, and texture) were measured after applying the practical nonthermal decontamination application. After HPP treatment for 7 min, inactivity rates were 4.4 to 6.7 Log CFU/g (100.0\%) for E. coli, Salmonella, and L. monocytogenes and 1.7 Log CFU/g (98.0\%) for S. aureus (P {\textless} 0.05). After treatment with UV LED for 24 h, reduced cell counts were 0.5 Log CFU/g (67.3\%), 0.7 Log CFU/g (82.2\%), and 0.3 Log CFU/g (47.1\%) for E. coli, Salmonella, and S. aureus, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05), but no significant reduction of 0.0 Log CFU/g (4.3\%) was observed for L. monocytogenes. When the beef was treated with HAW for 5 min, 0.6 Log CFU/g (73.3\%) of E. coli, 0.5 Log CFU/g (66.2\%) of Salmonella, 0.4 Log CFU/g (60.7\%) of S. aureus, and 0.5 Log CFU/g (65.6\%) of L. monocytogenes were inactivated. After the beef was treated with LA for 5 min, 1.8 Log CFU/g (98.5\%) of E. coli, 3.0 Log CFU/g (99.9\%) of Salmonella, 1.3 Log CFU/g (95.4\%) of S. aureus, and 1.9 Log CFU/g (98.6\%) of L. monocytogenes were inactivated. Modified atmosphere packaging for 48 h caused the inactivation of 0.3 Log CFU/g (51.8\%) of E. coli and 0.1 Log CFU/g (19.2\%) of Salmonella. After BGA treatment for 48 h, 0.3 Log CFU/g (55.2\%) of E. coli and 0.4 Log CFU/g (58.7\%) of Salmonella were significantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.05). HPP cooked the beef after 2 min of treatment. HAW and BGA changed the surface color of the beef, and LA reduced the pH of beef (P {\textless} 0.05). However, UV LED did not cause changes in the beef quality properties. These results indicates that UV LED can improve the food safety of raw beef without changes in beef quality.},

Regarding methodology, coarse-ground pork (ca. 35\% fat) was mixed with salt (2.5\%), dextrose (0.3\%), starter culture (ca. 7.0 log CFU/g), celery powder (0.5\%), and ground black pepper (0.3\%) and then separately inoculated with a multistrain cocktail (ca. 7.0 log CFU/g) of each pathogen. The batter was stuffed into a ca. 42-mm natural swine casing and fermented at 23 ± 2°C and ca. 95\% ± 4\% relative humidity to ≤pH 5.3 (≤48 h). Sausages were then dried at 12 ± 2°C and ca. 80\% ± 4\% relative humidity to a water activity (aw) of 0.89 (within 33 days) or aw 0.86 (within 60 days). A portion of each batch of fuet was subjected to high-pressure processing (HPP; 600 MPa for 3 min) before chubs were vacuum packaged and stored for 30 days at 20 ± 2°C. The results revealed that pathogen numbers remained relatively unchanged after fermentation (≤0.35 log CFU/g reduction), whereas reductions of ca. 0.8 to 3.2 log CFU/g were achieved after drying fuet to aw 0.89 or 0.86. Regardless of whether fuet was or was not pressure treated, additional reductions of ca. 2.2 to ≥5.3 log CFU/g after drying were achieved following 30 days of storage at 20°C. For non–HPP-treated fuet dried to aw 0.89 and stored for 30 days at 20°C, total reductions of ≥5.3 log CFU/g in levels of STEC or Salmonella spp. were achieved, whereas levels of L. monocytogenes were reduced by ca. 3.6 log CFU/g. Total reductions of ≥5.3 log CFU/g in levels of all three pathogens were achieved after drying non–HPP-treated fuet to aw 0.86. For fuet dried to aw 0.89 or 0.86, that were pressure treated and then stored for 30 days at 20°C, total reductions of {\textgreater}6.2 log CFU/g in levels of all three pathogens were achieved. In conclusion, the processing parameters tested herein, with or without application of HPP, validated that reductions of ≥2.0 or ≥5.0 log CFU/g in levels of STEC, Salmonella spp., and L. monocytogenes were achieved during preparation and storage of fuet.},

The two blends (pH 4 and 5) and coconut milk (pH 7) as a reference were subjected to HPP at 300–600 MPa, 20°C for 0.5–30 min; PEF at an electric field strength of 10–21 kV/cm, 40°C for 24 µs; and US at 120 µm amplitude, 25 or 45°C for 6 or 10 min. At least a 5-log reduction of E. coli was achieved at pH 4 by HPP at 400 MPa, 20°C for 1 min; PEF at 21 kV/cm, 235 Hz, 40°C for 24 µs; and US at 120 µm, 45°C for 6 min.

	abstract = {The inactivation kinetics of Listeria monocytogenes during High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) treatments was studied in a purple smoothie based of fresh fruit and vegetables. Pressure intensity studied was 300, 350, 400 and 450 MPa. Untreated samples were used as control. Furthermore, the effects on quality attributes (sensory, total soluble solids content, colour, titratable acidity, pH, vitamin C and total phenolics content) were also monitored. Microbial inactivation was modelled as a function of the HHP intensity using the Geeraerd model. Shoulder and tail effects were observed only for the 300 MPa pressure assayed, supporting a multiple hit kinetic inactivation of critical factors. Increasing the HHP intensity resulted in a faster inactivation with tailing. A strong positive correlation was observed between the pressure level and the inactivation rate (k). Hence, a linear model was used to describe the relationship between both variables. Nevertheless, further data are required to confirm this secondary model. Quality was mostly unaffected by the HHP treatments, except for the vitamin C content, which reported reductions of 26 and 21\% after 300 and 350 MPa, respectively. In conclusion, HHP can be a viable technology for processing fruit and vegetable-based smoothies to preserve quality and safety. A pressure of 400 MPa is advisable to ensure an efficient microbial inactivation with the best sensory and nutritional quality retention.},

	abstract = {The fruit and vegetable juice industry has shown a growing trend in minimally processed juices. A frequent technology used in the production of functional juices is cold pressure, which refers to the application of high pressure processing (HPP) at low temperatures to inactivate foodborne pathogens. HPP juice manufacturers are required to demonstrate a 5-log reduction of the pertinent microorganism to comply with FDA Juice HACCP. However, there is no consensus on validation study approaches for bacterial strain selection or their preparation. Individual bacterial strains were grown using three different growth conditions: neutral, cold-adapted, and acid-adapted. Approximately 6.0–7.0 log CFU/mL of the matrix-adapted bacterial strains were inoculated individually into buffered peptone water (BPW) at pH 3.50 ± 0.10 (HCl adjusted) and treated at sublethal pressures of 500 MPa for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and 200 MPa for Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes (180 s, 4°C). Analyses were conducted at 0, 24, and 48 h (4°C storage) post-HPP on nonselective media. E. coli O157:H7 exhibited greater barotolerance than Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes. In neutral growth conditions, E. coli O157:H7 strain TW14359 demonstrated the greatest resistance (2.94 ± 0.64 log reduction), and E. coli O157:H7 strain SEA13B88 was significantly more sensitive (P {\textless} 0.05). Salmonella isolates, neutral and acid-adapted, expressed similar barotolerance to one another. Cold-adapted S. Cubana and S. Montevideo showed greater resistance compared to other cold-adapted strains. Acid-adapted L. monocytogenes strain MAD328 had {\textless}1.00 ± 0.23 log reduction while acid-adapted L. monocytogenes strains CDC and Scott A were significantly more sensitive (P {\textless} 0.05) with reductions of 2.13 ± 0.48 and 3.43 ± 0.50 log CFU/mL, respectively. These results suggested, under the conditions tested, bacterial strain and preparation methods influence HPP efficacy and should be considered when conducting validation studies.},

Apple puree was inoculated with three foodborne pathogens and treated at pressures of 300–600 MPa for up to 7 min at 22 °C using HHP equipment. Increasing the pressure level and lowering the pH of apple puree led to larger microbial reductions, and E. coli O157:H7 showed higher resistance compared to S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes. Besides, approximately 5-log injured cells of E. coli O157:H7 were induced in apple puree at pH 3.5 and 3.8. HHP treatment at 500 MPa for 2 min effectively achieved complete inactivation of the three pathogens in apple puree at pH 3.5. For apple puree at pH 3.8, more than 2 min treatment of HHP at 600 MPa is seemingly needed to achieve complete inactivation of the three pathogens. Transmission electron microscopy analysis was conducted to identify ultrastructural changes in the injured or dead cells after HHP treatment. Plasmolysis and uneven cavities in the cytoplasm were observed in injured cells, and additional deformations, such as distorted and rough cell envelopes, and cell disruption occurred in dead cells. No changes in solid soluble content (SSC) and color of apple puree were observed after HHP treatment, and no differences were detected between control and HHP-treated samples during 10 d of storage at 5 °C. The results of this study could be useful in determining the acidity of apple purees or the treatment time at specific acidity levels when applying the HHP processing.},

These combined treatments inactivated 3.35 to at least 6.09 log10 cycles of S. Senftenberg 775/W, achieving comparable to greater inactivation as commercial TP (at pressures ≥ 200 MPa). The treated samples presented lower soluble protein and emulsifying activity than non-treated LWE, yet higher viscosity and improved foaming capacity. In contrast to commercial TP, the LWE treated by moderate pressure33Moderate pressure (MP) (MP) before a shorter TP (MP-TP) showed higher soluble protein (7\%) and viscosity (49\%), better emulsifying properties (27 – 67\%), and lower total carotenoids content (9\%). Concerning sensory analysis, egg tarts prepared with non-treated and treated LWE obtained similar sensory acceptability. Therefore, the heat sensitization effect induced by pressure pre-treatments on the S. Senftenberg 775/W population allows the reduction of TP time, a lethality effect equivalent to commercial TP and similar or improved functionality, being a very promising alternative to produce safe and better functional quality LWE.},

Of the seeds tested, radish seeds were found to be the most pressure sensitive, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100\% germination 9 days later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress seeds, on the other hand, were the most pressure resistant, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100\% germination 1 day later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress sprouts from seeds treated at 250 and 300 MPa also took about 1 day longer to reach average sprout length than sprouts from untreated control seeds did, indicating that sprout growth was not retarded once germination had occurred. Garden cress seeds were inoculated with suspensions of seven different bacteria (107 CFU/ml) and processed with high pressure. Treatment at 300 MPa (15 min, 20°C) resulted in 6-log reductions of Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli MG1655, and Listeria innocua, {\textgreater}4-log reductions of Shigella flexneri and pressure-resistant E. coli LMM1010, and a 2-log reduction of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis was virtually not inactivated. For suspensions of the gram-positive bacteria, similar levels of inactivation in water in the absence of garden cress seeds were found, but the inactivation of E. coli LMM1010 and S. flexneri in water in the absence of garden cress seeds was significantly less extensive. These data suggest that garden cress seeds contain a component that acts synergistically with high hydrostatic pressure against gram-negative bacteria.},

Tailing was observed in all the survival curves. A linear model and three nonlinear models were fitted to these data and the performances of these models were compared. The linear regression model for survival curves at four pressure levels had regression coefficients (R2) values of 0.785–0.962 and mean square error (MSE) of 0.265–0.893. A residual plot strongly suggested that a linear regression function was not appropriate as there was strong curvature in the plotted data. The nonlinear regression model using the log-logistic had R2 values of 0.946–0.982 and MSE values of 0.110–0.320. The Weibull model had R2 values of 0.944–0.975 and MSE values of 0.153–0.349. These results indicated that both were better models to describe the pressure inactivation kinetics of Y. enterocolitica in milk and buffer. Among the three nonlinear models studied, the modified Gompertz model produced the poorest fit to data. The number of parameters of the log-logistic model was reduced from four to two so that the model was greatly simplified. The reduced log-logistic model still produced a fit comparable to the full model. Since pressure had no significant effect on the shape factors of the Weibull model at the pressure levels of 300–400 MPa for buffer and 400–500 MPa for milk, models were developed to predict survival curves of Y. enterocolitica at pressures different from the experimental pressures.},

Some strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 were found to be relatively resistant to pressure. Further studies on the effect of substrate on pressure resistance were carried out on St. aureus, S. enteritidis and one of the resistant E coli O157:H7 strains. There was greater survival of the E. coli and S. enteritidis in ultra high- temperature treated (UHT) milk compared to poultry meat, while there was greater recovery of St. aureus in poultry meat than in the milk. There was evidence, assessed by differential plating using trypticase soy agar with and without additional NaCl, that sublethally injured E. coli O157:H7 cells were present at pressures significantly lower than were required for death. The simultaneous application of pressure with mild heating (up to 60° C) significantly increased the death of E. coli O157:H7 in poultry meat and UHT milk compared to either treatment alone. The variation in results obtained with different organisms, between strains of the same organism and in different substrates should be recognised when recommendations for the pressure processing of foods are being considered.},

In the absence of lysozymes, S. flexneri was more sensitive to HP in milk than in banana juice, while the opposite was observed for the other three bacteria. In combination with HP treatment, LaL was more effective than HEWL on all bacteria in both milk and banana juice. Depending on the bacteria, inactivation levels in banana juice were increased from 0.4–2.7 log units by HP treatment alone to 3.6–6.5 log units in the presence of 224 U/ml LaL. Bacterial inactivation in milk was also enhanced by LaL but only by 0.5–2.1 log units. Under the experimental conditions used, LaL was more effective in banana juice than in milk, while the effectiveness of HEWL under the same conditions was not significantly affected by the food matrix. This effect could be ascribed to the low pH of the banana juice since LaL was also more effective on E. coli in buffer at pH 3.8 than at pH 6.8. Since neither LaL nor HEWL are enzymatically active at pH 3.8, we analysed bacterial lysis after HP treatment in the presence of these enzymes, and found that inactivation proceeds through a non-lytic mechanism at pH 3.8 and a lytic mechanism at pH 6.8. Based on these results, LaL may offer interesting perspectives for use as an extra hurdle in high pressure food preservation.},

L. monocytogenes and V. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive to pressure changes, and S. flexneri was most resistant. The DP values were 16.3 MPa for L. monocytogenes, 21.7 MPa for V. parahaemolyticus, and 127.0 MPa for S. flexneri. The most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, S. flexneri, and most pressure-resistant gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus, were treated at 50°C and pressures of 0.1 to 650 MPa for 10 min. High temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two organisms and affected their sensitivities to pressure changes.

At 400 MPa for 5 min, Escherichia coli inactivation was 4 log in MC and 5.5 log in LWE, whereas no Salmonella Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, or Listeria monocytogenes were detected in either product. Staphylococcus aureus was the most pressure-resistant. In general, counts on the 3 media were not different. The TAL method allows differentiation of the inoculated pathogens from background microbiota.},

Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylabacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.},

The four models include an nth-order polynomial (n-OP) restricted to a cubic, the square root, classical log-linear and the Davey–Linear Arrhenius (D–LA). The percent variance accounted for (\%V) together with analyses of residuals was used as stringent criteria of model fit. The n-OP, square root, classical log-linear and D–LA models explained, respectively, an overall mean 77.9, 87.6, 84.1 and 89.1 \%V. The D–LA model is selected as that which best satisfied criteria established for goodness of fit. The model has three principal terms: treatment pressure (HPCP), time (t) and t2.

	abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effects of high-pressure processing on the immunoglobulin concentration, microbial load, viscosity, and transfer of passive immunity to calves when applied to bovine colostrum as an alternative to thermal pasteurization. A pilot study using Staphylococcus aureus was conducted to determine which pressure-time treatments are most appropriate for use with bovine colostrum, with the goals of maximizing bacterial inactivation while minimizing IgG content and viscosity changes. Following the pilot study, an inoculation study was conducted in which first-milking colostrum samples from Holstein-Friesian cows were inoculated with known concentrations of various bacteria or viruses and pressure processed at either 300 MPa for up to 60min or at 400MPa for up to 30min. The recovery of total native aerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Dublin, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, bovine herpesvirus type 1, and feline calicivirus were determined after processing. Colostrum IgG content was measured before and after pressure processing. Shear stress and viscosity for each treatment was determined over shear rates encompassing those found during calf feeding and at normal bovine body temperature (37.8°C). Following a calf trial, serum IgG concentration was measured in 14 calves fed 4 L of colostrum pressure processed at 400MPa for 15min. In the pilot study, S. aureus was effectively reduced with pressure treatment at 300 and 400MPa (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45min), with 2 treatments at 400MPa (30, 45min) determined to be inappropriate for use with bovine colostrum due to viscosity and IgG changes. High-pressure processing at 300MPa (30, 45, and 60min) and 400MPa (10, 15, and 20min) was shown to effectively reduce total native aerobic bacteria, E. coli, Salmonella Dublin, bovine herpesvirus type 1, and feline calicivirus populations in bovine colostrum, but no decrease occurred in Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. All inoculation study pressure treatments insignificantly decreased IgG content of colostrum. Treatment of colostrum at 400MPa for 15min during the calf trial decreased IgG content of colostrum. Treatment at 400MPa for 15min increased colostrum viscosity, with 2 of 14 samples requiring dilution with water for calf feeding. Calves fed pressure-processed colostrum had similar serum IgG but lower efficiency of absorption than calves fed heat-treated colostrum. The results of this study suggest that high-pressure processing of bovine colostrum maintains an acceptable IgG level while decreasing bacterial and viral counts. Changes in viscosity sometimes made calf feeding more difficult, but still feasible. Additional research to optimize this technology for on-farm use is necessary.},

Three strains of this specie (CECT 3017, 3020 and 3032) were independently inoculated into both skimmed (0.2\% fat) and whole milk (3.4\% fat) at an approximate load of 6.5 Log CFU/ml and submitted to HHP treatments at 300, 400 or 500 MPa for 10 m at 6°C and 20°C. Evolution of the surviving cells of the inoculated strains was evaluated analysing milk immediately after the treatments and after 5 and 8 d of storage at 6°C. HHP treatments at 300 MPa were seldom efficient at inactivating M. smegmatis strains, but lethality increased with pressure applied in all cases. Generation of sub-lethal injured cells was observed only after 400 MPa treatments since inactivation at 500 MPa was shown to be complete. Significant differences were not observed due to either temperature of treatment or fat content of milk, except for strain CECT3032, which was shown to be the most sensitive to HHP treatments. Milk inoculated with strain CECT3017 was submitted to ultra-high pressure homogenization (UHPH) treatments at 200, 300 and 400 MPa. Maximum reductions were obtained after 300 and 400 MPa treatments, although less than 3.50 Log CFU/ml were inactivated. UHPH did not cause significant number of injured cells. The usefulness of this species as a marker for pressure-based processing seems limited since it showed greater sensitivity than some pathogenic species including other Mycobacteria reported in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Exposure to high pressure is an efficient method of bacterial inactivation that is particularly important for reducing the microbial load present in foods. In this study, we examined the high pressure inactivation of Aeromonas hydrophila AH 191, a virulent strain that produces aerolysin, a cytotoxic, enterotoxic, and hemolytic toxin. High pressure treatment (250 MPa for 30 min at 25 °C in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) of A. hydrophila grown in milk reduced bacterial viability by at least 9 orders of magnitude. Under these conditions, the enterotoxic, hemolytic, and cytotoxic activities of A. hydrophila culture supernatants were unaltered. These results indicate the need for caution in the use of high pressure for food processing since although truly toxigenic bacteria may be inactivated, their toxins may not be, thus posing a risk to human health. At higher pressure (350 MPa) the inactivation of bacteria was much more effective. Scanning electron microscopy showed a significant decrease in the number of bacteria after higher pressurization (350 MPa for 1 h) and transmission electron microscopy showed irregular shaped bacteria, suggestive of important cell wall and membrane damage, and cytoplasm condensation. Practical Application: High pressure inactivates Aeromonas hydrophila efficiently but is enhanced when combined with moderate temperature (40 °C). The biological activities of toxins from this bacterium are unaltered under these conditions.},

Cultures were pressurized from 51 to 304 megaPascals (MPa) for 15 min in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), tryptic soy broth and radiation-sterilized ground pork. Trends in pressure response were similar in all three pressure menstrua. A 7-log10 CFU/g reduction of A. hydrophila in pork resulted from treatment of 253 MPa for 15 min. A 7-log10 CFU/g reduction of Y. enterocolitica in pork resulted from treatment of 304 MPa for 15 min. Pressure-induced injury of both pathogens was detected in all pressure menstrua at most pressure levels. No growth of either pathogen occurred in irradiated pork after pressurization of 128–203 MPa for 15 min and storage at 4C for 14 days; however, an upshift to 30C of cold-stored A. hydrophila in pork resulted in growth after a lag time of approximately 10 h, and an upshift to 30C of cold-stored Y. enterocolitica in pork resulted in recovery of injured cells within 2 h, and growth after a lag time of 4–6 h. This suggests that temperature abuse (30C) of pressure-processed pork for greater than 6 h would allow growth and possibly repair of A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica which survive following pressure treatment. Although neither the processor nor the consumer would likely abuse the product to such an extent, the results suggest that A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have the ability to repair or grow following pressure treatment in pork.},

High pressure is an alternative to thermal processing. The resistance of microorganisms to pressure varies considerably depending on the pressure range applied, temperature and treatment duration, and type of microorganism. Generally, Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to pressure than Gram-negative bacteria, moulds and yeasts; the most resistant are bacterial spores. The nature of the food is also important, as it may contain substances which protect the microorganism from high pressure. This article presents results of our studies involving the effect of high pressure on survival of some pathogenic bacteria -- Listeria monocytogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus hirae -- in artificially contaminated cooked ham, ripening hard cheese and fruit juices. The results indicate that in samples of investigated foods the number of these microorganisms decreased proportionally to the pressure used and the duration of treatment, and the effect of these two factors was statistically significant (level of probability, P},

	abstract = {Vegetative pathogens actively grow in foods, metabolizing and dividing their cells. They have consequently become a focus of concern for the food industry, food regulators and food control agencies. Although much has been done by the food industry and food regulatory agencies, foodborne outbreaks are still reported globally, causing illnesses, hospitalizations, and in certain cases, deaths, together with product recalls and subsequent economic losses. Major bacterial infections from raw and processed foods are caused by Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. High pressure processing (HPP) (also referred to as high hydrostatic pressure, HHP) is a non-thermal pasteurization technology that relies on very high pressures (400–600 MPa) to inactivate pathogens, instead of heat, thus causing less negative impact in the food nutrients and quality. HPP can be used to preserve foods, instead of chemical food additives. In this study, a review of the effect of HPP treatments on major vegetative bacteria in specific foods was carried out. HPP at 600 MPa, commonly used by the food industry, can achieve the recommended 5–8-log reductions in E. coli, S. enteritidis, L. monocytogenes, and Vibrio. Staphylococcus aureus presented the highest resistance to HPP among the foodborne vegetative pathogens investigated, followed by E. coli. More susceptible L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. bacteria were reduced by 6 logs at pressures within 500–600 MPa. Vibrio spp. (e.g., raw oysters), Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii and Aeromonas hydrophila generally required lower pressures (300–400 MPa) for inactivation. Bacterial species and strain, as well as the food itself, with a characteristic composition, affect the microbial inactivation. This review demonstrates that HPP is a safe pasteurization technology, which is able to achieve at least 5-log reduction in major food bacterial pathogens, without the application of heat.},

In this study, the effectiveness of a non-thermal method known as high-pressure processing (HPP) on the viable reduction of an HuNoV GII.4 strain on raw crabs was evaluated at three different pressures (200, 400, and 600 MPa). HuNoV viability in raw crabs was investigated by using propidium monoazide/sarkosyl (PMA) as a nucleic acid intercalating dye prior to performing a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The effect of the HPP exposure on pH, sensory, and Hunter colors were also assessed. HuNoV was reduced in raw crabs compared with control to HPP (0.15–1.91 log) in non-PMA and (0.67–2.23 log) in PMA. HuNoV genomic titer reduction was {\textless}2 log copy number/µL) when HPP was treated for 5 min without PMA pretreatment, but it was reduced to {\textgreater}2 log copy number/µL after PMA. The pH and Hunter colors of the untreated and HPP-treated raw crabs were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05), but sensory attributes were not significant. The findings indicate that PMA/RT-qPCR could be used to detect HuNoV infectivity without altering the quality of raw crabs after a 5 min treatment with HPP. Therefore, HuNoV GII.4 could be reduced up to 2.23 log in food at a commercially acceptable pressure duration of 600 MPa for 5 min.},

Aiming to evaluate the inactivation effect of high-hydrostatic-pressure (HHP) on GI.5 and GⅡ.4 HuNoV, we placed GI.5 and GⅡ.4 HuNoV in oyster (Crassostrea virginica) digestive gland (DG) homogenate and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under the pressure of 200, 300, 400, and 500 MPa at 5 °C for 5 min. Propidium monoazide (PMAxx)-RT-qPCR and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to evaluate the inactivation effect. The physical, chemical, and taste characteristics were also analyzed to evaluate the sensory quality of oysters. The results showed that PMAxx-RT-qPCR could effectively distinguish infectious HuNoV. The tolerance of GI.5 HuNoV to HHP was higher than that of GII.4. DG homogenate had a certain protective effect on HuNoV to tolerate higher pressure. Two types of HuNoV in homogenate and buffer all decreased below the detection limit (500 MPa/5 min). The pH, hardness, springiness, and chewiness of oysters treated by HHP were enhanced. Therefore, HHP treatment under 500 MPa at 5 °C for 5 min can effectively eliminate HuNoV and maintain oyster quality. The data could inform the development of methods to control HuNoV in oysters and the safety of raw oysters for consumption.},

In this study, human norovirus genogroup II was allowed to bio-accumulate in oysters, and then the effect of high-pressure processing (HPP) on human noroviruses in oysters was determined through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method with enzymatic pretreatment to distinguish infectious noroviruses. As a result, oysters could be artificially contaminated to a detectable level of norovirus genome by the reverse transcription-PCR. Concentrations of norovirus genome in laboratory-contaminated oysters were log normally distributed, as determined by the real-time PCR, suggesting that artificial contamination by bio-accumulation was successful. In two independent HPP trials, a 1.87 log10 and 1.99 log10 reduction of norovirus GII.17 genome concentration was observed after HPP at 400 MPa for 5 min at 25°C.

The objectives of this research were (i) to determine the effects of HPH alone or with an emulsifier (lecithin) on human norovirus surrogates-murine norovirus (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCVF9)- in skim milk and orange juice, and (ii) to determine HPH effects on FCV-F9 and MNV-1 in orange and pomegranate juice blends. Experiments were conducted in duplicate at 0, 100, 200, 250, and 300 MPa for {\textless} 2 s and plaque was assayed in duplicate. In milk, FCV-F9 was reduced by ≥4 and ∼1.3 log PFU/ml at 300 and 250 MPa, respectively, and ≥4- and ∼1-log PFU/ml reductions were obtained in orange juice at 300 and 250 MPa, respectively. In orange juice or milk combined with lecithin, FCVF9 was reduced to nondetectable levels at 300 MPa, and by 1.77 and 0.78 log PFU/ml at 250 MPa. MNV-1 in milk was reduced by ∼1.3 log PFU/ml only at 300 MPa, and by ∼0.8 and ∼0.4 log PFU/ml in orange juice at 300 and 250 MPa, respectively. MNV-1 in milk or orange juice containing lecithin at 300 MPa showed 1.32- and 2.5-log PFU/ml reductions, respectively. In the pomegranate-orange juice blend, FCV-F9 was completely reduced, and MNV-1 was reduced by 1.04 and 1.78 log PFU/ml at 250 and 300 MPa, respectively.

	abstract = {Human noroviruses (HNoV) have been implicated in gastrointestinal outbreaks associated with fresh produce, juices, and ready-to-eat foods. In order to determine the risk of HNoV transmission by contaminated blueberry juice, survival characteristics of cultivable HNoV surrogates (murine norovirus, MNV-1; feline calicivirus, FCV-F9; and bacteriophage MS2) in blueberry juice (pH = 2.77) after 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days at refrigeration temperatures (4°C) were studied. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) was studied as a novel processing method for noroviral surrogate inactivation in blueberry juice. Blueberry juice or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2 as control) was inoculated with each virus, stored over 21 days at 4°C or subjected to HPH, and plaque assayed. FCV-F9 (∼5 log(10) PFU/mL) was undetectable after 1 day in blueberry juice at 4°C. MNV-1 (∼4 log(10) PFU/ml) showed minimal reduction (1 log(10) PFU/mL) after 14 days, with greater reduction (1.95 log(10) PFU/mL; p {\textless} 0.05) after 21 days in blueberry juice at 4°C. Bacteriophage MS2 (∼6 log(10) PFU/mL) showed significant reduction (1.93 log(10) PFU/mL; p {\textless} 0.05) after 2 days and was undetectable after 7 days in blueberry juice at 4°C. FCV-F9 remained viable in PBS for up to 21 days (2.28 log(10) PFU/mL reduction), while MNV-1 and MS2 survived after 21 days (1.08 and 0.56 log(10) PFU/mL reduction, respectively). Intriguingly, FCV-F9 and bacteriophage MS2 showed reduction after minimal homogenization pressures in blueberry juice (pH = 2.77), possibly due to the combination of juice pH, juice components, and mechanical effects. MNV-1 in blueberry juice was only slightly reduced at 250 (0.33 log(10) PFU/mL) and 300 MPa (0.71 log(10) PFU/mL). Virus surrogate survival in blueberry juice at 4°C correlates well with the ease of HNoV transmission via juices. HPH for viral inactivation in juices is dependent on virus type, and higher homogenization pressures may be needed for MNV-1 inactivation.},

	abstract = {Detection of human norovirus (HuNoV) usually relies on molecular biology techniques, such as qRT-PCR. Since histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are the functional receptors for HuNoV, HuNoV can bind to porcine gastric mucin (PGM), which contains HBGA-like antigens. In this study, PGM-conjugated magnetic beads were used to collect and quantify potentially infectious HuNoV strains GI.1 and GII.4 treated by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). Both GI.1 and GII.4 strains used in this study showed increasing pressure sensitivity as judged by loss of PGM binding with decreasing temperature over a range of 1 to 35 °C. Both GI.1 and GII.4 were more resistant to pressure at pH4 than at neutral pH. Because GI.1 was significantly more resistant to pressure than GII.4, it was used to evaluate HuNoV pressure inactivation in blueberries. GI.1 on dry blueberries was very resistant to pressure while immersion of blueberries in water during pressure treatments substantially enhanced the inactivation. For example, a 2 min-600 MPa treatment of dry blueberries at 1 and 21 °C resulted in {\textless}1-log reductions while a 2.7-log reduction of GI.1 was achieved by a treatment at 500 MPa for 2 min at 1 °C when blueberries were immersed in water. In total, this novel study provides unique information for designing pressure processing parameters (pressure, temperature, and time) and product formulations (such as pH) to inactivate HuNoV in high-risk foods such as berries.},

In 2011, an estimated 9.4 million illnesses, 55,961 hospitalizations, and 1,351 deaths were attributed to known foodborne pathogens in the USA including Norovirus caused the most illnesses; nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., norovirus, Campylobacter spp., and Toxoplasma gondii caused the most hospitalizations; and nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., T. gondii, Listeriamonocytogenes, and norovirus caused the most deaths [Scallan et al. (Emerg Infect Dis 17:7–15, 2011)]. Several factors influence the incidence of pathogens in the meat and poultry food supply, some of the more important factors are livestock production practices that may inadvertently foster pathogen contamination; the emergence of “new” and antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the environment; increased manipulation and handling and accelerated processing of carcasses and raw materials; modification of traditional processing practices and greater complexity of manufacturing procedures and equipment; a more complex distribution and food preparation system that increases the risk of foodborne disease; more discriminate and selective pathogen detection methods to improve confirmation and trace-back of contaminated product; and consumer habits that represent inappropriate food handling and preparation practices [Keeton and Eddy (Preharvest and postharvest food safety—contemporary issues and future directions. Blackwell, Ames, 2004)]. The surface decontamination treatments of meat and poultry could improve the safety of these products and help to reduce foodborne illnesses. Details of some surface decontamination treatments of raw meat and poultry are discussed in this review.},

The heat and pressure time-inactivation curves obtained with the calicivirus showed tailing in the logarithmic scale.

The developed model enables the prediction of the calicivirus reduction in response to pressures up to 500 MPa, temperatures ranging from 5 to 75°C, and various treatment times.

Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) are particularly prone to exposure to NVs due to the brackish environment in which they are farmed which is known to be susceptible to human faecal contamination. High hydrostatic pressure processing (HHP) is a food treatment technique that has been shown to inactivate NV.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we investigated the ability of HHP to inactivate murine norovirus (MNV-1), a recognised surrogate for NV, in experimentally contaminated manila clams. Pools of contaminated live clams were subjected to hydrostatic pressure ranging from 300 to 500 MPa for different time intervals of between one and 10 min. The trial was repeated three times, at monthly intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Virus vitality post-treatment was assessed and the data obtained indicates that the use of high hydrostatic pressures of at least 500 MPa for 1 min was effective in inactivating MNV-1.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: HHP results to be an effective technique that could be applied to industrial process to obtain safe Manila clams ready to eat.},

Currently, the infectivity of human NoVs is poorly understood due to the lack of a cell culture system. In this study, we determined the survival of a human NoV genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) strain in seeded oyster homogenates after high-pressure processing (HPP) using a novel receptor binding assay and a gnotobiotic pig model. Pressure conditions of 350 MPa at 0°C for 2 min led to a 3.7-log10 reduction in the number of viral RNA copies in oysters, as measured by the porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic bead (PGM-MB) binding assay and real-time RT-PCR, whereas pressure conditions of 350 MPa at 35°C for 2 min achieved only a 1-log10 reduction in the number of RNA copies. Newborn gnotobiotic piglets orally fed oyster homogenate treated at 350 MPa and 0°C for 2 min did not have viral RNA shedding in feces, histologic lesions, or viral replication in the small intestine. In contrast, gnotobiotic piglets fed oysters treated at 350 MPa and 35°C for 2 min had high levels of viral shedding in feces and exhibited significant histologic lesions and viral replication in the small intestine. Collectively, these data demonstrate that (i) human NoV survival estimated by an in vitro PGM-MB virus binding assay is consistent with the infectivity determined by an in vivo gnotobiotic piglet model and (ii) HPP is capable of inactivating a human NoV GII.4 strain at commercially acceptable pressure levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The contamination of shellfish with gastroenteric viruses may cause outbreaks because they are often eaten raw or under-cooked. High-hydrostatic pressure treatments have already proven to be effective in reducing high viral load in shellfish samples. The objectives are the assessment of the viral load reduction of contaminated clams using HHP treatments at different pressures and times and the study of the changes caused by these treatments in some food physical parameters.
METHODS: Clams were contaminated with a solution containing Feline Calicivirus; they were closed in envelopes and treated with 300, 400, 500, 600 MPa for 1, 3, 5, 7 min for every pressure value. After the treatment the residual viral titre was calculated. The texture parameters were obtained after treating clams samples at the same pressure values but only for 3 and 7 min and analysing them with a TPA test.
RESULTS: HHP treatments of 500 and 600 MPa were sufficient to cause a total inactivation at every timelength considered while with 300 and 400 MPa after 1 min, concentrations of 1.13 and 0.55 respectively were found. In general hardness and gumminess tend to increase after the treatment whereas springiness and cohesiveness decrease a bit.
CONCLUSIONS: HHP treatments showed good sterilization ability against FCV but it's necessary to consider that FCV has a lower resistance to disinfection than Human norovirus. Texture changes are in line with what is reported in literature.},

	abstract = {Murine norovirus (strain MNV-1), a propagable norovirus, was evaluated for susceptibility to high-pressure processing. Experiments with virus stocks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium demonstrated that at room temperature (20°C) the virus was inactivated over a pressure range of 350 to 450 MPa, with a 5-min, 450-MPa treatment being sufficient to inactivate 6.85 log10 PFU of MNV-1. The inactivation of MNV-1 was enhanced when pressure was applied at an initial temperature of 5°C; a 5-min pressure treatment of 350 MPa at 30°C inactivated 1.15 log10 PFU of virus, while the same treatment at 5°C resulted in a reduction of 5.56 log10 PFU. Evaluation of virus inactivation as a function of treatment times ranging from 0 to 150 s and 0 to 900 s at 5°C and 20°C, respectively, indicated that a decreasing rate of inactivation with time was consistent with Weibull or log-logistic inactivation kinetics. The inactivation of MNV-1 directly within oyster tissues was demonstrated; a 5-min, 400-MPa treatment at 5°C was sufficient to inactivate 4.05 log10 PFU. This work is the first demonstration that norovirus can be inactivated by high pressure and suggests good prospects for inactivation of nonpropagable human norovirus strains in foods.},

	abstract = {Filter feeding bivalve molluscan shellfish such as oysters, mussels and clams can readily accumulate norovirus present in growing water contaminated by human faecal material from point and non-point sources. While pre-harvest preventative interventions are preferable, post-harvest interventions such as depuration, relaying and thermal treatment have been used to mitigate the risk of norovirus infection associated with shellfish consumption. However, even with available pre- and post-harvest interventions, norovirus outbreaks associated with shellfish consumption are still reported worldwide. Analyses of faecal indicator bacteria, i.e. total coliforms, Escherichia coli or Enterococci spp. are commonly used to classify shellfish growing waters. Such classifications are used as a pre-harvest intervention, to identify when harvesting should be restricted and/or determine the necessity of post-harvest treatments. Post-harvest depuration treatment does not necessarily remove norovirus from shellfish tissue, and freezing has little or no effect on norovirus infectivity in shellfish. Thermal treatments can inactivate norovirus but they also change the organoleptic characteristics of shellfish which makes them unacceptable to some consumers. High pressure processing is an alternative post-harvest intervention that has potential to inactivate norovirus effectively with a reduction of 2.8–4.0 log10 genome copies at 300–450 MPa. However, a human challenge showed that less than 600 MPa are not sufficient to prevent norovirus infection when people consume artificially-contaminated shellfish. This study critically evaluates the applicability of, and the challenges associated with, these interventions to improve shellfish safety.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus has been recognised as a food-borne virus hazard in pork products, due to its zoonotic properties. This risk can be reduced by adequate treatment of the food to inactivate food-borne viruses. We used a spectrum of viruses and bacteriophages to evaluate the effect of three food treatments: high pressure processing (HPP), lactic acid (LA) and intense light pulse (ILP) treatments. On swine liver at 400 MPa for 10 min, HPP gave log10 reductions of ≥4.2, ≥5.0 and 3.4 for feline calicivirus (FCV) 2280, FCV wildtype (wt) and murine norovirus 1 (MNV 1), respectively. Escherichia coli coliphage ϕX174 displayed a lower reduction of 1.1, while Escherichia coli coliphage MS2 was unaffected. For ham at 600 MPa, the corresponding reductions were 4.1, 4.4, 2.9, 1.7 and 1.3 log10. LA treatment at 2.2 M gave log10 reductions in the viral spectrum of 0.29-2.1 for swine liver and 0.87-3.1 for ham, with ϕX174 and MNV 1, respectively, as the most stable microorganisms. The ILP treatment gave log10 reductions of 1.6-2.8 for swine liver, 0.97-2.2 for ham and 1.3-2.3 for sausage, at 15-60 J cm-2, with MS2 as the most stable microorganism. The HPP treatment gave significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) greater virus reduction on swine liver than ham for the viruses at equivalent pressure/time combinations. For ILP treatment, reductions on swine liver were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) greater than on ham for all microorganisms. The results presented here could be used in assessments of different strategies to protect consumers against virus contamination and in advice to food producers. Conservative model indicators for the pathogenic viruses could be suggested.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of acute and chronic hepatitis in humans. The zoonotic HEV genotype 3 is the main genotype in Europe. The foodborne transmission via consumption of meat and meat products prepared from infected pigs or wild boars is considered the major transmission route of this genotype. High hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) is a technique, which can be used for inactivation of pathogens in food. Here, preparations of a cell culture-adapted HEV genotype 3 strain in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were subjected to HPP and the remaining infectivity was titrated in cell culture by counting fluorescent foci of replicating virus. A gradual decrease in infectivity was found by application of 100 to 600 MPa for 2 min. At 20 °C, infectivity reduction of 0.5 log10 at 200 MPa and 1 log10 at 400 MPa were observed. Slightly higher infectivity reduction of 1 log10 at 200 MPa and 2 log10 at 400 MPa were found by application of the pressure at 4 °C. At both temperatures, the virus was nearly completely inactivated ({\textgreater}3.5 log10 infectivity decrease) at 600 MPa; however, low amounts of remaining infectious virus were observed in one of three replicates in both cases. Transmission electron microscopy showed disassembled and distorted particles in the preparations treated with 600 MPa. Time-course experiments at 400 MPa showed a continuous decline of infectivity from 30 s to 10 min, leading to a 2 log10 infectivity decrease at 20 °C and to a 2.5 log10 infectivity decrease at 4 °C for a 10 min pressure application each. Predictive models for inactivation of HEV by HPP were generated on the basis of the generated data. The results show that HPP treatment can reduce HEV infectivity, which is mainly dependent on pressure height and duration of the HPP treatment. Compared to other viruses, HEV appears to be relatively stable against HPP and high pressure/long time combinations have to be applied for significant reduction of infectivity.},

FCV was inactivated by 3.6-log10 TCID50 mL−1 after 120 s treatment with 300 MPa, and was undetectable after 180 s treatment with 300 MPa. PV was the most resistant with little or no substantial reduction in titre after 300 s treatment with 600 MPa. The studies were designed to determine the efficacy of using high pressure to inactivate enteric viruses and generate inactivation data to assist in determining appropriate process criteria for safe shellfish production.
Industrial relevance
The high pressure treatment of raw oysters has proved commercially successful, due in part to a marked increase in the product’s shelf life, yet little alteration of its organoleptic properties. Illnesses from human enteric viruses such as hepatitis A virus and norovirus have traditionally been associated with shellfish consumption, and for this reason, studies have examined the stability of enteric viruses under high pressure. However, kinetic data on enteric virus stability under pressure is needed by processors to better understand the response of viruses throughout the entire treatment time. The kinetic data obtained in this study may be useful for processors wishing to alter high pressure processing conditions to ensure a high quality product in terms of organoleptic and microbiological properties.},

This study confirms that HPP is effective in inactivating representative enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in human milk and reducing bacterial load, with no adverse effect on macronutrient and energy composition.

The HAV samples were treated at 400 MPa for 1 min at 5, 20, and 50 degrees C. Decreasing solution pH enhanced pressure inactivation of HAV. This enhanced inactivation effect was most evident at 20 degrees C. A baroprotective effect was observed for NaCl concentrations from 1 to 6\%. For example, a treatment of 400 MegaPascals (MPa) for 1 min at 50 degrees C reduced the HAV titers by 4.0, 4.1, 1.3 and 0.4 log plaque forming units (PFU)/ml for NaCl concentrations of 0, 1, 3, and 6\%, respectively. Overall, increasing the treatment temperature enhanced pressure inactivation of HAV in the solutions. The pressure resistance of HAV in oysters was also examined. Temperature in the range of 5 to 50 degrees C did not significantly affect the pressure inactivation of HAV within oyster homogenates. It is concluded that HPP treatment of oysters at temperatures above room temperature would not provide any additional benefit for inactivation of HAV. However, the observation that HAV inactivation is enhanced in acidic matrices is information that may be useful for designing product formulations and processing parameters for high pressure processing of products such as low pH fruit juices and salsa.},

Our aim was to compare the antiviral activity of human milk processed by Holder pasteurization (HoP) or high-pressure processing (HPP) against representative enveloped and non-enveloped viruses including cytomegalovirus and hepatitis A virus. Expressed milk from 20 donors collected from the Ontario Milk Bank was combined into 10 pools, each from two unique donors. Each pool was processed by HoP (62.5°C, 30 min) or HPP (500 MPa, 8 min, 4°C) and subsequently inoculated with cytomegalovirus or hepatitis A virus to achieve a final concentration of 5-log plaque-forming units/mL. Plaque reduction assays were used to quantify detectable virus after 30 min incubation (room temperature). Post hoc experiments using a 4 h incubation time were conducted if reductions were detected at 30 min. Irrespective of processing, cytomegalovirus concentrations declined in all pools after 30 min incubation (P {\textless} 0.0001). Milk processed by HoP exhibited significantly less reduction compared to raw milk (P = 0.0069). In post hoc experiments, anti-cytomegalovirus activity was maintained at 4 h, with high inter-pool variability. Hepatitis A virus concentration remained unchanged after 30 min incubation in raw and processed milk. Anti-cytomegalovirus activity in human milk is preserved following HoP and HPP, persisting up to 4 h post-inoculation; anti-hepatitis A virus activity was not observed in raw or processed milk. Further research is needed to understand how HoP or promising alternative processing methods affect the antiviral activity of donated milk, given its potential importance to recipient infants.},

Individual Weibull curves generally provided a good fit at each pressure and salinity, but the curve shapes were qualitatively inconsistent between treatments, making interpolation between pressures difficult and unreliable. High variability was observed in the inactivation data, but the log-linear model described the entire data set and interpolated between specific treatment conditions. Therefore, this model was evaluated by using high pressure to treat HAV artificially inoculated into Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) homogenate adjusted to 15 or 30 g/liter salinity. The log-linear model generally provided fail-safe predictions at pressures ≥375 MPa and may aid shellfish processors wishing to incorporate HPP into an oyster processing regime. Additional inactivation data with greater reproducibility should be collected to enable expansion of the model and to increase the accuracy of its predictions.},

Hepatitis A virus was equally sensitive in puree and onions at pressures {\textgreater} or = 350 MPa. For treatments of {\textless} 325 MPa, the virus was more sensitive to pressure in strawberry puree than in sliced onions with log reductions of 1.2, 2.06, and 3.13 observed for strawberries and 0.28, 0.72, and 1.42 observed for onions after 5-min treatments at 250, 275, and 300 MPa, respectively. Although high-pressure processing may cause some organoleptic alterations to strawberries and onions, results show high-pressure processing will inactivate hepatitis A virus in these foods.},

Study of HPP's potential to inactivate foodborne viruses has defined general pressure levels required to inactivate hepatitis A virus, norovirus surrogates, and human norovirus itself within foods such as shellfish and produce. The sensitivity of a number of different picornaviruses to HPP is variable. Experiments suggest that HPP inactivates viruses via denaturation of capsid proteins which render the virus incapable of binding to its receptor on the surface of its host cell. Beyond the primary consideration of treatment pressure level, the effects of extending treatment times, temperature of initial pressure application, and matrix composition have been identified as critical parameters for designing HPP inactivation strategies. Research described here can serve as a preliminary guide to whether a current commercial process could be effective against HuNoV or HAV.},

	abstract = {In preterm infants, sterilized donor milk (DM) is frequently used for feeding when breast milk is lacking. Most human milk banks use the Holder pasteurization method (HoP) to ensure the microbiological safety of DM. However, this method degrades many bioactive factors and hormones. Recently, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing, which preserves bioactive factors in human milk, has been proposed as an alternative method to ensure the safety of DM. Although HHP treatment has been shown to be effective for viral inactivation, the effect of HHP on viruses that may be present in the complex nutritional matrix of human milk has not yet been defined. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of two HHP protocols (4 cycles at 350 MPa at 38 °C designated as 4xHP350 treatment, and 1 cycle at 600 MPa at 20 °C designated as 1xHP600 treatment) with the HoP method on artificially virus-infected DM. For this purpose, we used human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) as surrogate models for enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Our results showed that HCoV-229E is inactivated by HHP and HoP treatment. In particular, the 4xHP350 protocol is highly effective in inactivating HCoV-229E. However, our results demonstrated a matrix effect of human milk on HCoV-229E inactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HEV is stable to moderate pressure HHP treatment, but the milk matrix does not protect it from inactivation by the high-pressure HHP treatment of 600 MPa. Importantly, the complex nutritional matrix of human milk protects HEV from inactivation by HoP treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HHP and HoP treatments do not lead to complete inactivation of both surrogate virus models, indicating that these treatments cannot guarantee total viral safety of donor milk.},

The antirotaviral activity of dairy fractions was barely affected by treatments below 500 MPa for 15 min, with the greatest activity loss of 17\%. High temperature-short time pasteurization was not significantly harmful to the antirotaviral activity of any of the milk proteins tested, which maintained 90–100\% of their activity.

HPP can inactivate microorganisms, including viruses, with minimal influence on the physicochemical and sensory properties of foods.

The HPP inactivation of foodborne viruses in foods depends on high-pressure processing parameters (pressure, temperature, and duration time) or non-processing parameters such as virus type, food matrix, water activity (aw), and the pH of foods. HPP was found to be effective for the inactivation of foodborne viruses such as HuNoV, HAV, HAstV, and HuAdV in foods. HPP treatments have been found to be effective at eliminating foodborne viruses in high-risk foods such as shellfish and vegetables.

It has been extensively examined using prokaryotic organisms but has had limited study on eukaryotic organisms. Treatment using HPP has been shown to be effective in inactivating nematode larvae in food and Ascaris suum eggs. Nothing is known on the efficacy of HPP on tapeworm cysts or eggs. Eggs of important zoonotic tapeworms including Echinococcus and Taenia spp. can potentially contaminate water and food intended for human consumption. The present study examined the efficacy of HPP on the viability of Hymenolepis diminuta eggs. Efficacy of HPP treatment was measured using an egg hatch assay in two experiments. One thousand unhatched H. diminuta eggs in Hanks balanced salt solution were packaged in sealable bags and exposed to 100-600megapascals (MPa; 1MPa=10atm=147psi) for 60s in a commercial HPP unit. Positive (no HPP) and negative (No HPP but frozen/thawed) controls were examined in each experiment. None of the HPP untreated and frozen eggs (negative controls) were able to hatch or exclude trypan blue when placed in the hatching solution in experiment 1 or 2. HPP untreated and nonfrozen eggs (positive controls) hatched and excluded trypan blue; 75\% were positive in experiment 1 and 80\% were positive in experiment 2. No hatched eggs were observed when they were exposed to 300-600MPa for 60s. Treatment at 400MPa and above caused rupturing of the oncosphere. Results from this study indicate that HPP is a possible method to inactivate tapeworm eggs and that the susceptibility of tapeworm eggs to HPP is similar to or greater than that of nematode eggs or tissue larvae.},

The keywords searched were (((effects OR infectivity OR resistance) AND Toxoplasma) AND oocyst). We selected 16 articles that described 309 different treatments. Among all the protocols evaluated, 35.60\% (110/309) were effective in inactivating oocysts. Physical methods were more effective than other methods (p {\textless}0.05). Sporulated oocysts and the T. gondii VEG strain were more resistant (p {\textless}0.05) to treatments. Although it is effective against viruses and bacteria, the use of disinfectants in water has little or no effect on T. gondii oocysts. The use of radiation and pressure were effective in inactivating oocysts, as these treatments do not include changes in temperature, they can be used in foods for raw consumption, such as vegetables, as it will not cause substantially changes in their physical and chemical characteristics. Therefore, these methods can be viable alternatives for the control of T. gondii.},

The present study evaluated the efficacy of an alternative non-thermal food-processing treatment, high hydrostatic pressure, on the viability of T. gondii bradyzoites in raw and dry-cured ham. Meat of pigs experimentally exposed to 4000 oocysts of T. gondii VEG strain was vacuum-packaged and subjected to high pressure processing (HPP). Tap water (6 °C ± 1 °C) was used as the pressure-transmitting fluid, and its temperature during HPP increased 2.7 °C per 100 MPa. The effect was evaluated by bioassay in mice followed by qPCR. In raw ham, 100–400 MPa/1 min did not inactivate T. gondii, whereas 600 MPa/20 min was effective. In dry-cured ham, 600 MPa for 3 or 10 min were not effective and a 20-min treatment was required to render the bradyzoites non-infectious for mice. Our results point toward the potential use of HPP as a tool for risk control of T. gondii and as a food safety guarantee.
Industrial relevance text
Under real production conditions, the usual HPP treatments applied by the food industry to control L. monocytogenes and other pathogenic bacteria are 600 MPa of pressure and holding times of 3–10 min. Our study demonstrated, however, that longer treatment times are required to inactivate the parasite and, thus, to guarantee the safety of raw and dry-cured meats in order to reduce the public health risk of toxoplasmosis. Further research is needed to evaluate other HPP conditions, including pulsed cycles, for the inactivation of T. gondii in foods of animal origin.},

	abstract = {The prevalence, size, genome, and life cycle of Eimeria acervulina make this organism a good surrogate for Cyclospora cayetanensis, a protozoan that causes gastroenteritis in humans, including recent outbreaks in the United States and Canada associated with contaminated raspberries and basil. Laboratory studies of C. cayetanensis are difficult because of the lack of readily available oocysts and of infection models and assays. UV radiation and high-hydrostatic-pressure processing (HPP) are both safe technologies with potential for use on fresh produce. Raspberries and basil were inoculated with sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at high (106 oocysts) and low (104 oocysts) levels, and inoculated and control produce were treated with UV (up to 261 mW/cm2) or HPP (550 MPa at 40°C for 2 min). Oocysts recovered from produce were fed to 3-week-old broiler chickens, which were scored for weight gain, oocyst shedding, and lesions at 6 days postinoculation. Oocysts exhibited enhanced excystation on raspberries but not on basil. Birds fed oocysts from UV-treated raspberries had reduced infection rates, which varied with oocyst inoculum level and UV intensity. Birds fed oocysts from UV-treated raspberries (104 oocysts) were asymptomatic but shed oocysts, and birds fed oocysts from UV-treated basil (104 oocysts) were asymptomatic and did not shed oocysts. Birds fed oocysts from HPP-treated raspberries and basil were asymptomatic and did not shed oocysts. These results suggest that UV radiation and HPP may be used to reduce the risk for cyclosporiasis infection associated with produce. Both treatments yielded healthy animals; however, HPP was more effective, as indicated by results for produce with higher contamination levels.},

	abstract = {Eimeria acervulina is a protozoan parasite that can cause intestinal lesions and reduced weight gain in chickens. E. acervulina oocysts were treated by high hydrostatic pressure and evaluated for pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and structural integrity. Pressure treatment of E. acervulina oocysts at 550 MPa for 2 min at 4, 20 or 40 °C rendered the parasites nonpathogenic to chickens. Pressure treatment at 40 °C also prevented fecal shedding of oocysts. Upon challenge with non-pressurized E. acervulina oocysts, partial immunity was observed with a reduction in lesion severity in chickens that had been inoculated with pressure-treated oocysts. No changes to the fragility and permeability of the oocyst wall or excystation of sporocysts were observed as a result of pressure treatment. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed no changes to the whole oocyst or sporocysts. Recovery and the morphology of excysted sporozoites were altered by pressure treatment. These results suggest that pressure affects sporozoite integrity.
Industrial relevance
High-hydrostatic pressure processing has been shown to inactivate various microorganisms and is utilized commercially for enhanced food safety and quality. Some pathogenic microorganisms have been inactivated by HPP yet retain immunogenic properties suggesting potential application for vaccine development. Eimeria acervulina is a poultry pathogen for which new vaccines are sought. E. acervulina is also closely related to Cyclospora cayetanensis, a foodborne human pathogen. HPP was explored for effect on E. acervulina for potential vaccine development for chickens and for insight on HPP effects on parasites for enhanced safety of human foods.},

	abstract = {Background
Among 24 foodborne parasites ranked by FAO/WHO, 15 are associated with food of non-animal origin (FoNAO). Control of these hazards is essential for food safety.
Scope and approach
Control measures to inactivate parasites in FoNAO are reviewed. Preventing contamination is key to ensuring the safety of fresh produce. However, additional control measures can further reduce the likelihood of occurrence of infectious parasites in FoNAO. Key Findings and Conclusions: The efficacy of treatments depends on parasite species, developmental stage, matrix, and application conditions. Conventional pasteurization (72 °C; 15 s) inactivates parasites in most matrices, although some parasites are more heat resistant, and this may be an inappropriate method for many FoNAO that are intended for eating fresh and raw. Freezing at −20 °C for 2 days inactivates most, but not all, parasites, and some are highly resistant to freezing. Parasites generally survive chemical disinfection, making its application at effective doses often unsuitable at an industrial scale. Ozone and chlorine dioxide are the most promising in terms of efficacy and dosage, nevertheless challenges remain in their application especially for the most fragile produce. High-pressure processing is an efficient technology, providing good inactivation of parasites. Further research should focus on standardizing experimental approaches for evaluation of inactivation techniques and development of methods to measure parasite inactivation in food matrices.},

The inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum and other pathogens in raw molluscan shellfish would provide increased food safety for normal and at-risk consumers. The present study identified the efficacy of a non-thermal alternative food-processing treatment, high hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP), on the viability of C. parvum oocysts in the Eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were artificially exposed to 2 × 107 oocysts of the Beltsville strain of C. parvum in seawater and subjected to HPP treatments. The effects of the treatments were evaluated by inoculation of the processed oyster tissues into neonatal mice. High-pressure processing of shucked Eastern oysters at all pressures tested (305, 370, 400, 480, and 550 MPa) was significantly effective (P{\textless}0.05) in reducing the numbers of positive mouse pups fed treated oyster tissues exposed to C. parvum oocysts. A dose of 550 MPa at 180 s (s) of holding time produced the maximum decrease in numbers of C. parvum positive mouse pups (93.3\%). Measurement of tristimulus color values of HPP-treated raw oysters at extended processing times from 120 s to 360 s at 550 MPa showed a small increase in whiteness of oyster meat. This non-thermal processing treatment shows promise for commercial applications to improve safety of seafood and reduce public health risks from cryptosporidiosis.},

The modeling procedure is based on a previous model (S. Koseki and K. Yamamoto, Int. J. Food Microbiol. 116:136-143, 2007) that describes the probability of death of bacteria. The model developed in this study consists of a total of 300 combinations of pressure (400, 450, 500, 550, or 600 MPa), pressure-holding time (1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 min), temperature (25 or 40°C), inoculum level (3, 5, or 7 log10 CFU/ml), and medium (TSB or IF), with each combination tested in triplicate. For each replicate response of E. sakazakii, survival and death were scored with values of 0 and 1, respectively. Data were fitted to a logistic regression model in which the medium was treated as a dummy variable. The model predicted that the required pressure-holding times at 500 MPa for a 5-log reduction in IF with 90\% achievement probability were 26.3 and 7.9 min at 25 and 40°C, respectively. The probabilities of achieving 5-log reductions in TSB and IF by treatment with 400 MPa at 25°C for 10 min were 92 and 3\%, respectively. The model enabled the identification of a minimum processing condition for a required log reduction, regardless of the underlying inactivation kinetics pattern. Simultaneously, the probability of an inactivation effect under the predicted processing condition was also provided by taking into account the environmental factors mentioned above.},

After determining the subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) of TQ against C. sakazakii, changes in the percent survival of bacteria under heat, acid, desiccation, and hyperosmotic stress following exposure to TQ were investigated in tryptone soya broth (TSB) and reconstituted infant formula (RIF). We also monitored changes in the expression of stress tolerance-associated genes in the TQ-treated bacteria, and used a minimum inhibitory concentration assay to examine changes in the antibiotic sensitivity of C. sakazakii following TQ treatment, SIGs of TQ of 200, 400, and 600 mu M were selected for use in the assays. TQ-treated C. sakazakii strains showed a significant decrease in survival following exposure to high temperatures (50 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 60 degrees C), acidic pH (similar to 3.3), high osmotic pressure (a(w) = 0.81), and desiccation (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with untreated controls in both TSB and RIF. TQ treatment also increased the sensitivity of C. sakazakii to ampicillin and cefoxitin. Moreover, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the transcription levels of 15 genes associated with stress tolerance was downregulated following TQ treatment (600 mu M). Therefore, our findings suggest that TQ has a significant negative impact on the stress tolerance of C. sakazakii, and provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of TQ as a natural antimicrobial agent in food production.},

The strain proved resistant to scCO(2) treatment up to 50 MPa pressure at temperatures {\textgreater}73 degrees C for at least 20 min in a commercial infant formula. Water availability was shown to be important for the observed thermotolerance, because introduction of water in the scCO(2) gas flow during treatment resulted in a 1 log(10) cfu/g reduction of the initial inoculum. Interestingly, similar tolerance to heat and scCO(2) treatment was observed in a less complex matrix, a maltodextrin powder. In contrast, the bacterial strain proved sensitive to lower temperatures (55-65 degrees C) over shorter times ({\textless}= 10 min) in a dextrose powder composed of crystalline particles. Therefore, the microorganism demonstrates heat sensitivity in the crystalline powder matrix closer to that of nonpowder liquid matrices. These data demonstrate the increased heat tolerance of the bacterium specifically in amorphous powders and indicate that this characteristic is not dependent on fat and other components commonly found in infant formula.

This study aims to explore the inactivation mechanism of E. sakazakii induced by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), which, unlike conventional heat treatment, is a nonthermal technique for pasteurization and sterilization of dairy food without deleterious effects. The mortality of E. sakazakii under minimum reaction conditions (50 MPa) was 1.42\%, which was increased to 33.12\% under significant reaction conditions (400 MPa). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescent staining results showed that 400 MPa led to a loss of physical integrity of cell membranes as manifested by more intracellular leakage of nucleic acid, intracellular protein and K+. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis presents a downregulation of three functional genes (glpK, pbpC, and ompR), which were involved in cell membrane formation, indicating a lower level of glycerol utilization, outer membrane protein assembly, and environmental tolerance. In addition, the exposure of E. sakazakii to HHP modified oxidative stress, as reflected by the high activity of catalase and super oxide dismutase. The HHP treatment lowered down the gene expression of flagellar proteins (fliC, flgI, fliH, and flgK) and inhibited biofilm formation. These results determined the association of genotype to phenotype in E. sakazakii induced by HHP, which was used for the control of food-borne pathogens.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This article reviews the latest clinical and fundamental research data on the important human pathogen Clostridium difficile.The clinical aspects of C. difficile infection (CDI) that are discussed include description of the disease spectrum and severity, and the signs, symptoms and clinical pathogenesis of CDI. An overview of the available treatment options for CDI is also given, including discussion of the problems associated with each therapeutic approach and new recommendations for treatment based on disease severity and the numbers of recurrences. CDI prevention is also discussed. Prevention methods include preventing acquisition of C. difficile spores by patients (using barrier and cleaning methods) and reducing the risk of symptomatic infection if the organism is encountered, primarily by avoidance of unnecessary use of antimicrobials.The laboratory diagnosis and characterization of C. difficile is also reviewed. The main detection methods and diagnostic tests, including the recent development of molecular testing and two-step diagnostic protocols, are discussed. The main molecular typing techniques used for C. difficile and the importance of antibiotic resistance testing are described.The changing epidemiology of CDI is reviewed. Important changes in the epidemiology of CDI have been observed over the past five years, especially increased infection rates in hospitals, increased disease severity, and increased rates and mortality with patient age. Most of these changes are presumed to be driven by presence of a new epidemic strain, C. difficile BI/NAP1/027. Changes in host populations (human versus animal populations with previous low risk), a possible increase in community associated disease, and new risk factors have also been observed.The known C. difficile virulence factors (TcdA and TcdB) and newly recognized virulence factors and their role in pathogenesis are discussed.The role of antibiotics in the development of CDI is discussed in relation to the susceptibility of C. difficile to antibiotics taken by the patient. The implication of the resistance of C. difficile to the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, and fluoroquinolones as an increasing risk factor for CDI, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) continues to affect patients in hospitals and communities worldwide. The spectrum of clinical disease ranges from mild diarrhoea to toxic megacolon, colonic perforation and death. However, this bacterium might also be carried asymptomatically in the gut, potentially leading to 'silent' onward transmission. Modern technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing and multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis, are helping to track C. difficile transmission across health-care facilities, countries and continents, offering the potential to illuminate previously under-recognized sources of infection. These typing strategies have also demonstrated heterogeneity in terms of CDI incidence and strain types reflecting different stages of epidemic spread. However, comparison of CDI epidemiology, particularly between countries, is challenging due to wide-ranging approaches to sampling and testing. Diagnostic strategies for C. difficile are complicated both by the wide range of bacterial targets and tests available and the need to differentiate between toxin-producing and non-toxigenic strains. Multistep diagnostic algorithms have been recommended to improve sensitivity and specificity. In this Review, we describe the latest advances in the understanding of C. difficile epidemiology, transmission and diagnosis, and discuss the effect of these developments on the clinical management of CDI.},

The severity of C. difficile infection is determined by strain virulence, interactions with intestinal commensal microbial communities, and the host immune response to damage of the intestinal epithelium that is induced by C. difficile.The ability to sporulate and germinate is essential to C. difficile virulence. Hundreds of genes that are involved in sporulation and germination have been identified as well as a bile acid receptor that induces germination.C. difficile secretes toxin proteins that are internalized by host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and cause disruption to cytoskeletal architecture, which leads to cell death. Toxin-mediated cell death results in the loss of intestinal barrier integrity and the translocation of bacteria into underlying tissues.The intestinal microbiota provides colonization resistance against C. difficile infection. Commensal bacteria that are capable of converting primary bile acids to secondary bile acids inhibit the growth of C. difficile by depriving C. difficile spores of an important germinant and by increasing the concentration of secondary bile acids in the intestinal lumen, which are toxic to the vegetative form of C. difficile.Toxin-mediated damage to the epithelium activates the host inflammatory immune response. The role of the immune system is to limit epithelial damage and the dissemination of intestinal bacteria into the circulation. However, an overly robust inflammatory response can be damaging to the host and contribute to disease pathology.},

C. difficile is the leading cause of health-care-associated infective diarrhoea. The life cycle of C. difficile is influenced by antimicrobial agents, the host immune system, and the host microbiota and its associated metabolites. The primary mediators of inflammation in C. difficile infection (CDI) are large clostridial toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), and, in some bacterial strains, the binary toxin CDT. The toxins trigger a complex cascade of host cellular responses to cause diarrhoea, inflammation and tissue necrosis — the major symptoms of CDI. The factors responsible for the epidemic of some C. difficile strains are poorly understood. Recurrent infections are common and can be debilitating. Toxin detection for diagnosis is important for accurate epidemiological study, and for optimal management and prevention strategies. Infections are commonly treated with specific antimicrobial agents, but faecal microbiota transplants have shown promise for recurrent infections. Future biotherapies for C. difficile infections are likely to involve defined combinations of key gut microbiota.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) places a huge economic and practical burden on healthcare facilities. Furthermore, rCDI may affect quality of life, leaving patients in an rCDI cycle and dependant on antibiotic therapy.
AIMS: To discuss the importance of microbiologic factors in the development of rCDI.
SOURCES: Literature was drawn from a search of PubMed from 2000 onwards with the search term 'recurrent Clostridium difficile infection' and further references cited within these articles.
CONTENT: Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown that CDI and rCDI risk factors are similar. Development of rCDI is attendant on many factors, including immune status or function, comorbidities and concomitant treatments. Studies suggest that poor bacterial diversity is correlated with clinical rCDI. Narrow-spectrum gut microflora-sparing antimicrobials (e.g. surotomycin, cadazolid, ridinilazole) are in development for CDI treatment, while microbiota therapeutics (faecal microbiota transplantation, nontoxigenic C. difficile, stool substitutes) are increasingly being explored. rCDI can only occur when viable C. difficile spores are present, either within the gut lumen after infection or when reacquired from the environment. C. difficile spore germination can be influenced by gut environmental factors resulting from dysbiosis, and spore outgrowth may be affected stage by some antimicrobials (e.g. fidaxomicin, ramoplanin, oritavancin).
IMPLICATIONS: rCDI is a significant challenge for healthcare professionals, requiring a multifaceted approach; optimized infection control to minimize reinfection; C. difficile-targeted antibiotics to minimize dysbiosis; and gut microflora restoration to promote colonization resistance. These elements should be informed by our understanding of the microbiologic factors involved in both C. difficile itself and the gut microbiome.},

In the context of recent increase in the incidence and severity of C. difficile infections (CDI), an accurate diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment and prevention, but continues to be challenging.
AIMS: The present article reviews each key step of CDI diagnosis including stool selection, methods and strategies used, and interpretation of the results.
SOURCES: The most recent guidelines for CDI diagnosis published by scientific societies were reviewed.
CONTENT: CDI diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory tests confirming the presence of toxigenic strain or toxins in stools. Stool selection is crucial and can be improved by implementing rejection criteria and a strict policy for appropriate testing. Multiple laboratory tests detecting different targets (free toxin or presence of a potentially toxigenic strain) are commercially available. However, none of these tests combine high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose CDI, low hands-on time and low cost. An optimized diagnosis can be achieved by implementing a two- or three-step algorithm. Algorithms currently recommended by the ESCMID comprise a screening test with high sensitivity followed by a more specific test to detect free toxins. Presence of free toxins in stools has been shown to better correlate with severe outcome whereas nucleic acid amplification tests may lead to an over-diagnosis by detecting asymptomatic carriers of a toxigenic strain.
IMPLICATION: To date, no single test can accurately diagnose CDI. Guidelines from the ESCMID recommend a two- or three-step algorithm for optimal CDI detection.},

	abstract = {Background
The increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in healthcare settings in Europe since 2003 has affected both patients and healthcare systems. The implementation of effective CDI surveillance is key to enable monitoring of the occurrence and spread of C. difficile in healthcare and the timely detection of outbreaks.
Aims
The aim of this review is to provide a summary of key components of effective CDI surveillance and to provide some practical recommendations. We also summarize the recent and current national CDI surveillance activities, to illustrate strengths and weaknesses of CDI surveillance in Europe.
Sources
For the definition of key components of CDI surveillance, we consulted the current European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) CDI-related guidance documents and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) protocol for CDI surveillance in acute care hospitals. To summarize the recent and current national CDI surveillance activities, we discussed international multicentre CDI surveillance studies performed in 2005–13. In 2017, we also performed a new survey of existing CDI surveillance systems in 33 European countries.
Content
Key components for CDI surveillance are appropriate case definitions of CDI, standardized CDI diagnostics, agreement on CDI case origin definition, and the presentation of CDI rates with well-defined numerators and denominators. Incorporation of microbiological data is required to provide information on prevailing PCR ribotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility to first-line CDI treatment drugs. In 2017, 20 European countries had a national CDI surveillance system and 21 countries participated in ECDC-coordinated CDI surveillance. Since 2014, the number of centres with capacity for C. difficile typing has increased to 35 reference or central laboratories in 26 European countries.
Implications
Incidence rates of CDI, obtained from a standardized CDI surveillance system, can be used as an important quality indicator of healthcare at hospital as well as country level.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile is a notorious pathogenic species that can cause severe gastrointestinal infections in humans and animals. C. difficile infection (CDI) results in thousands of deaths worldwide every year. The elucidation of related mechanisms of CDI and exploration of potential therapeutic strategies are largely delayed due to the lack of efficient genetic engineering tools for C. difficile strains.
METHODS: Plasmids carrying the CRISPR-Cas9 system were constructed and transformed into C. difficile through conjugation. Mutants were identified using colony PCR with primers annealing to the regions flanking the target gene deletion/integration locus. Heat-survival assay was used to compare the sporulation frequency between the mutant with spo0A deletion and the wild type strain. The fluorescence in the mutant with the insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inspected under a fluorescent microscope.
RESULTS: An efficient genome editing tool was developed for C. difficile based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. With this tool, spo0A was deleted with a 100\% mutation efficiency. Conversely, an anaerobic GFP gene was successfully inserted into the C. difficile chromosome (with a mutation efficiency of 80\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The developed CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering tool will facilitate functional genomic studies in C. difficile as well as the elucidation of mechanisms related to host-bacteria interaction and pathogenesis of CDI. This will be highly beneficial for the development of innovative strategies for CDI diagnostics and therapies.},

The literature shows that approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the development of clinical-support systems have benefits that are increasingly recognized. However, there is a lack of available high-volume data, necessary for trusting such AI models. One effective method in this situation involves the simulation of realistic data. Existing simulators primarily focus on implementing compartmental epidemiological models and contact networks to validate epidemiological hypotheses. Nevertheless, other practical aspects such as the hospital building distribution, shifts or safety policies on infections has received minimal attention. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for a simulator of nosocomial infection spread, combining agent-based patient description, spatial-temporal constraints of the hospital settings, and microorganism behavior driven by epidemiological models. The predictive validity of the model was analyzed considering micro and macro-face validation, parameter calibration based on literature review, model alignment, and sensitive analysis with an expert. This simulation model is useful in monitoring infections and in the decision-making process in a hospital, by helping to detect spatial-temporal patterns and predict statistical data about the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) remains the leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea, posing treatment challenges because of antibiotic resistance and high relapse rates. Faecal microbiota transplantation is a novel treatment strategy to prevent relapses of C. difficile infection (CDI), however, the exact components conferring colonization resistance are unknown, hampering its translation to a medicinal product. The development of novel products independent of antibiotics, which increase colonization resistance or induce protective immune mechanisms is urgently needed.
OBJECTIVES: To establish a framework for a Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) of C. difficile, in which healthy volunteers are exposed to toxigenic C. difficile spores, offering the possibility to test novel approaches and identify microbiota and immunological targets. Whereas experimental exposure to non-toxigenic C. difficile has been done before, a toxigenic C. difficile CHIM faces ethical, scientific, logistical, and biosafety challenges.
SOURCES: Specific challenges in developing a C. difficile CHIM were discussed by a group of international experts during a workshop organized by Inno4Vac, an Innovative Health Initiative-funded consortium.
CONTENT: The experts agreed that the main challenges are: developing a clinically relevant CHIM that induces mild to moderate CDI symptoms but not severe CDI, determining the optimal C. difficile inoculum dose, and understanding the timing and duration of antibiotic pretreatment in inducing susceptibility to CDI in healthy volunteers.
IMPLICATIONS: Should these challenges be tackled, a C. difficile CHIM will not only provide a way forward for the testing of novel products but also offer a framework for a better understanding of the pathophysiology, pathogenesis, and immunology of C. difficile colonization and infection.},
