{"title":"Host immune response","markdown":{"headingText":"Host immune response","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe host response to CDI is driven predominantly by innate immune cells, especially innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and neutrophils, which are essential for early containment of the infection and tissue repair. Adaptive immunity, including antibody production, is more critical for long-term protection and reducing recurrence rather than for resolving acute infection. As a result, the immune response to *C. difficile* often controls the bacterium's damage without completely clearing it, which can lead to persistent colonization.\n\nThe immune response to CDI involves a well-coordinated effort by both innate and adaptive immune systems. Innate immune cells, especially ILCs and neutrophils, are crucial for the initial control of infection and tissue repair, while adaptive immunity, primarily through antibody production, plays a key role in reducing recurrence. The inflammatory response, although essential for managing the infection, needs to be carefully balanced to avoid excessive tissue damage and further complications. Persistent colonization remains a challenge, highlighting the immune system's role in managing rather than fully eradicating *C. difficile* in the gut.\n\n### Early Cellular Response\n\n-   **Barrier Disruption**: *C. difficile* toxins TcdA and TcdB disrupt the epithelial barrier of the colon, increasing gut permeability and allowing bacterial and toxin translocation into deeper tissues.\n\n-   **Immune Cell Recruitment**: Damaged epithelial and resident immune cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2), which recruit innate and adaptive immune cells to the infection site.\n\n### Innate Immunity\n\n#### Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)\n\n-   ILCs play a critical role in defending against CDI by responding to early inflammatory signals like IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-23. They produce cytokines such as IL-22, IL-17a, IFN-γ, and TNF, which activate neutrophils and macrophages. These cytokines also promote antimicrobial peptide production, release of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), and help in epithelial repair.\n\n-   **Significance of ILCs**: Studies with Rag1−/− mice (which lack T and B cells) indicate that recovery from CDI can occur without adaptive immunity. However, in mice lacking both ILCs and adaptive immune cells (Rag1−/−Il2rg−/−), high mortality rates suggest that ILCs are crucial for early defense against *C. difficile*.\n\n#### Key ILC Subtypes\n\n-   **ILC1s**: Produce IFN-γ, enhancing macrophage activity and promoting phagocytosis.\n\n-   **ILC3s**: Secrete IL-22, which stimulates antimicrobial peptides and activates the complement system to clear bacteria that translocate to organs like the liver and lungs.\n\n#### Role of Neutrophils\n\n-   Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the infection site in response to cytokines (e.g., IL-23 and GM-CSF) and play a crucial role in CDI defence. They release ROS in response to *C. difficile* toxins, particularly TcdB, and produce IFN-γ, which boosts macrophage bactericidal activity.\n\n### Adaptive Immunity\n\n#### Antibody Production\n\n-   Although T and B cells are not essential for resolving acute CDI, toxin-specific antibodies (IgA and IgG) contribute to reducing disease severity and recurrence. Higher antibody levels are associated with reduced risk of recurrence.\n\n-   While T cells are not central to acute recovery, they support long-term immunity. Mice deficient in MHC II, which affects CD4+ T cell function, show reduced toxin-specific antibody responses and weaker secondary infection protection, indicating that CD4+ T cells support adaptive immune memory.\n\n-   **Monoclonal Antibody Therapy**: Clinical trials have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting TcdA and TcdB reduce recurrence rates in CDI patients, highlighting the protective role of antibodies in long-term infection control.\n\n### Defense Mechanisms\n\n-   **Antimicrobial Peptides and ROS/RNS Production**: Immune cells produce antimicrobial peptides, ROS, and RNS to combat *C. difficile* and prevent further translocation. RNS can modify the cysteine protease domains of TcdA and TcdB through S-nitrosylation, inhibiting toxin activation by preventing the release of glucosyl transferase domains (GTDs) in the cytosol.\n\n-   **Toxin Neutralization**: This modification limits the toxins' potency, decreasing cellular damage and mitigating disease severity.\n\n### Inflammatory Cascade and Cytokine Production\n\n-   **NF-κB and AP-1 Pathways**: Toxins trigger NF-κB and AP-1 pathways in epithelial cells, leading to the production of various pro-inflammatory chemokines that attract more immune cells to the infected area.\n\n-   **Inflammasome Activation**: TcdB's glycosylation activity inactivates RHO GTPases, which are detected by the pyrin receptor in epithelial cells. This detection activates the inflammasome, causing the release of IL-1β, a cytokine that amplifies the inflammatory response and recruits additional immune cells.\n\n### Balancing Inflammation\n\n-   **Protective vs. Harmful Inflammation**: While inflammation is essential for controlling CDI, excessive ROS production can exacerbate epithelial damage. Studies show that mice lacking the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 have better survival outcomes, suggesting that moderate inflammation is protective, while excessive inflammation can worsen tissue damage.\n\n-   **Influence of Disease Variables**: Variables such as the type of antibiotic pre-treatment, *C. difficile* inoculum composition, and specific experimental protocols influence disease severity. These insights can help develop therapeutic strategies that aim to balance the immune response, minimizing tissue damage while effectively controlling infection.\n\n### Persistence of Colonization\n\n-   **Incomplete Clearance**: Even in hosts with competent immune systems, *C. difficile* may persist in the gut post-infection. The immune response generally limits the infection and aids in tissue repair, rather than completely clearing *C. difficile*, which may lead to asymptomatic colonization or recurrence if conditions favor bacterial growth again.\n\n### Host Factors and Personalized Risk Profiles\n\n-   Genetic Susceptibility: Advances in genetic studies have identified specific host genetic markers, such as variations in immune response genes (e.g., TLR4, IL-8), that are associated with increased CDI susceptibility. This research has implications for personalized risk assessment and targeted prevention strategies.\n\n-   Immune Response Modulation: Studies reveal that certain immune-modulating treatments, such as checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer, can increase CDI susceptibility. Understanding immune responses to C. difficile in these populations is leading to new preemptive treatment strategies, such as prophylactic probiotics or FMT in at-risk patients.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"css":["styles.css"],"include-after-body":["footer.html"],"output-file":"chapter_6.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
